 This will go on the evolutionary ethics page. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_ethics, it will go after the section called """"Further reading""""  

 Evolutionary ethics struggles as a system of normative ethics, which asks the question """"what should I do?"""" It struggles due to the logical fallacy of turning a statement about what is, into one about what we ought to do (see naturalistic fallacy). As a meta-ethical theory, one that tells us the nature of moral judgments, evolutionary ethics can be used as a decent descriptor on why we have certain views on right and wrong. As a meta-ethical claim it does not tell us what is right and wrong, but rather that the origin of our ethical practices come from our evolutionary history. This tends to lead to a less black and white view on ethical beliefs and leaves much more room for gray areas.   

 Many philosophers who support this view of evolutionary meta-ethics use it to undermine Aristotelian teleology, a belief that we can't reduce things to the parts that compose them, but the end they are trying to achieve is very important. At times evolutionary ethics is used to undermine moral realism, a view that morals are objectively true and do not rely upon a person’s thoughts or attitudes. However other philosophers still use evolution to champion moral realism. Often they will argue that there is a set of moral truths and that our behavior naturally tend towards moral truths because of evolution. 

 More often however, it is used to support moral subjectivism. This is a belief that moral truths are subjective and often times based on cultural norms, thoughts, and attitudes towards a subject matter rather than a set of mind-independent truths. Evolutionary ethics assumes we have a set of basic underlying morals, such as not killing another person. This stems from the evolutionary need to allow the species to survive. Then some of the more graininess of ethics comes from the differences in cultural upbringings and backgrounds, and thus the finer points of ethics would be considered subjective.

 :Looking at the issue again, and having checked some of my previous assumptions and found them to be incorrect, I'm inclined to agree with you.  I was not aware that there was text in the article itself clarifying that the book was commercially available (which a reader might assume it was not, after reading that PublishAmerica withdrew their """"acceptance"""") and with that information available in the article text, the article links become redundant.  Also, it is clearly inappropriate to link to the Amazon page for a book, since Amazon has no relationship to a book other than retailing it; however, I don't think the same can be said automatically about linking to the book's publisher.

 == Please resist the urge to spin == 

 As a gay gamer who has been playing video games since the 1976 Fairchild, I can say that I have been FAR from impressed with the representation of gay identity in video gaming. I can tolerate ridiculous stereotypical depictions of gay folk, but what is worse is the systematic censorship. Classifying mere gay identity as """"mature/sexual/adult"""" is one way of enabling retailers like Wal-Mart to de-gay their shelves and content creators to de-gay their products, citing sales concerns. It is patently discriminatory to act as if being openly gay is """"more sexual"""" than being openly hetero, yet people blithely accept this double-standard all the time. 

 While there isn't much news coverage to be found about this, the Christian Right is driving quite a bit of this. Their scare tactics routinely include trying to convince parents that gays are after their children. Having openly gay characters in video games, especially when they're not villains and fools, is a threat to their system of using us as pawns in their quest for power. 

 The Sims proved people wrong who declared """"only hetero males play video games"""". Besides, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy to make products designed to appeal to the taste of one demographic and proclaim that others simply have no interest in gaming in the first place. It's quite convenient. How much of this dearth of gay content (and I don't mean token content) is due to the fact that most developers are heterosexual men? 

 So, please resist the urge to spin the history of gays-in-gaming as being much rosier than it is. Even The Sims titles censor us, making us """"convert"""" people into homosexuals (a very offensive thing to force a gay person to do, let me tell you) and force characters into romantic interactions. A token non-foolish non-evil gay character here and there does not equate to an industry in which people like myself truly feel there are products that are non-narrow. And, frankly, the phrase """"the pink dollar"""" itself is rather offensive. The money I earn is green. When I touch it it doesn't transform due to """"the gay"""". Historically-minded folks may also want to remember that pink was the color for boys and blue was the color for girls in the 19th century. I would hope that developers will start seeing an end to heterosexism and homophobia as being more about creative freedom than cash."""

 Hi. Regarding your edits to 1% (South Park), please do not rearrange the plot summary, as there is no reason for A-plot and B-plot to be summarized separately. Care should be taken to provide them in a way that mirrors how they occurred concurrently as much as possible. Also 

 *""""Fifth Graders"""" is not a proper noun. 
 *""""This incites Butters and Jimmy, and an angry group of Fifth Graders with an idea"""" is wrong. Butters and Jimmy came up with one idea, and the fifth graders came up with a different one. 
 *Regarding the passage """"Despite being at Token's house, mistaking a concerned Stan, Kyle, and Kenny as the killers, the real killer manages to get inside and proceeds to put Muscle Man Marc in boiling water. Finding Rumper Tumpskin, Cartman is forced to watch his toy's head blown off by the culprit, Cartman's doll Polly Prissypants. """" two points: First, it is only necessary to summarize the plot. All we need to inform the reader is that more of Cartman's toys are being destroyed. We do not need to emphasize specific details about the mutilations. This is why the previous summary is more streamlined. Second, you mention Rumper Tumpskin and Muscle Man Marc, without explain who or what they are. Given the number of varied non-human and fantasy characters that appear in the series, you can't assume that readers know who these people are. This is another reason why just saying, """"Despite being at Token's house, Cartman discovers Muscle Man Marc and Rumper Tumpskin, two more of his toys, destroyed, with the remaining one, a doll named Polly Prissypants, sitting in an armchair with a revolver, claiming responsibility for all the toy 'murders'."""" is simpler and better.

I don't know what this mysterious DNA testing is that """"silence speaks volumes as to why it hasn't [been done]"""". Do you mean extracting DNA from ancient bones? It's not easy to do that. DNA degrades over time. Do you mean testing modern populations to model ancestry? That is being done, but actually there is often resistence from indigenous peoples who suspect some sort of experimentation is being performed on them. See this response to the Human Genome Diversity Project, an attempt to create a genetic map of all human populations .

 == Taxobox removal == 

 I removed the taxobox. The article seems to be about a common name that refers to most (or all) species of two cetacean families.   

 :This was reverted here, with the edit summary Revert - information in infobox takes this into account, provides useful information. Dolphin is a common name for some species of the two families, not a single scientific taxon. The article explains this fact, I would not remove """"useful information"""". The specious inclusion is very misleading, it is best explained in the article. What reliable source would state it refers to these two taxa, when some of them have the common name of whale? Why should the taxobox be used for an article about a non systematic name?   

 ::I wouldn't  have a problem with having two families in the taxobox, except that under current taxonomy this one is now incorrect.  I am not concerned about the fact that some dolphins have a common name of """"whale"""", since most authoritative sources would recognize those species dolphin species despite the common name, since all are in Delphinidae.  But the problem is that the River Dolphins have now been split into multiple families, so just using """"Delphinidae and Platanistoidea"""" is no longer correct.  And rather than include five families in the taxobox, which becomes somewhat spurious, it seems better to remove the taxobox and discuss the taxonomy in the article.    

 :::What if the family section is just left out? Or be given a note like """"See article""""? I like the infobox and it does provide useful data and a basic glance at where dolphins fit in in the animal kingdom (it never fails to amaze me how many people do not seem to realise dolphins are mammals!). Looking at some other articles, there's no consensus on the infobox usage. The whale article has no infobox for example, while many others such as the shark, lizard or turtle articles do have them.    

 ::I have a problem with original research being used in our document. This would include basing a taxon on a common name, there is no concordance between common names and biological nomenclature. A reader comes here to acquire facts, those few who do not know they are mammals can gain that information from the content proper of the article. The two families, or even five, are not given an accepted taxon; the fact that some reliable sources (also!) name some of the species as Dolphins is incidental, not authoritative. Everyone likes the taxobox, let us be careful with our names here most of all, it is not an infobox. I appreciate that the undue weight given to other names appended to the correct name may cause this misapprehension, but the consensus is that a taxobox should summarise a single taxon and be included in only one article. Whale is without one for reasons that are intimately linked with this article's title. The other examples you have given are [hopefully] given in RS that state, unequivocally, a common name refers to a taxon: """"Sharks (superorder Selachimorpha)""""; """"Lizards (Suborder: Lacertilia) are a very large and widespread group of reptiles of the order Squamata"""" [highly debatable, but still a single taxon]; and superorder Chelonia (turtles) is yet another reptilian (Sauropsida) example that needed resolving. Removing duplicated or specious (spurious) taxoboxes is never popular with those who had a notion to include them, I'm not sure why, but it is certain to be the right path for clarifying explanations to our dear readers. An article on the common name 'dolphin' is justified, it could be more than a dab, but it is not a taxon. Please undo the unfounded revert of my edit.   

 :::All dolphins belong to the suborder of Odontoceti, every animal mentioned in this article does, so the taxobox """"tree"""" is correct (especially considering my last edit) - so no incorrect data is given in the box. I don't feel the definition of a dolphin as used in this article is based on original research, but is what is quite commonly accepted as what animals are covered under the word dolphin.

I don't think I need to mention it because it's totally irrelevant how many people oppose something. It does NOT count how many are on which side, it counts what is behind: arguments and truth. With your lies and will to mislead people by depicting the game as something it is not, you're runnining against a wall of truth and arguments and I'll make sure you won't tear that wall down, no matter if you're a biased AA players or a biased admin on the site. I'm right, and you know that very well. And even if you are in the majority, this rule remains true: """"Something is still right, even if everyone thinks it's not. Something is wrong even if everyone thinks it's right."""" You don't EVEN think you're right, you just pretend! Knock off your pathetic pretence for I only accept the truth, and the truth only.

Search the official forum for the word """"propaganda"""", you'll find nothing. """"Many""""? What a liar you are. You represent not """"many"""" players, you'll represent ONE. And you disagree just for the sake of disagreeing.

 """" From advergame to propagame """" 

 """"The message America's Army sends itself is propagandistic. It propagandises a certain kind of lifestyle message in which the army would like the participant to join and become. Propaganda itself has a history within religion. Religion also sends the same message, to let the participant (or the participant in becoming) join and become the religion (so sending the message of religion). So America's Army, with its governmental background, is instead of an advergame, better to be described as a propagame.""""

The nation's youth can expect a lot more from their friendly army of one.""""( 'America's Army' Targets Youth by Jacob Hodes & Emma Ruby Sachs)"""" 

 """" From the analysis of the advergame and the striking resemblance I have described with the propagame America's Army I will now turn my attention to the consequences for communication on Internet by such games."""" 

 """" The exception is America's Army because it communicates itself as a company in which citizens can join. The aim is to let the gamers themselves join the company as an employee and be the producers within of the message the army sends. One of the aims of advergames is to construct a process of viral marketing, but this is done unlike the propagame. The advergame aims that consumers virally communicate about the game or the message it beholds for the purpose of spreading the word, but not to become one with the company itself. DaimlerChrysler for example wouldn't make a game in which one is being trained to become the director of a car factory (this would create competition). Not yet (emphasised), but maybe in the future it will when one seeks for employees.""""

Or are you saying that the """"exclusive"""" part is not needed, because """"primary"""" takes care of it?

This sentence is technically true as written, but could probably be made more NPOV by changing the phrase """"abortion rights"""" to """"abortion"""", like so: He opposes the role of women in preaching roles, opposes abortion, and believes that homosexuality is a sin.  Reasoning:  The use of the phrase """"abortion rights"""" of necessity implies a right to abortion, and demonizes Mohler by casting him in the role of opposing a fundamental human right.  While it can most certainly be argued this is true, Mohler's own argument (and that of the entire pro-life movement) is that abortion is not a fundamental human right, it is murder.

 Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Thai domestic passenger ticket.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here. 

 Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.  

 If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """""""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

Apparently this is not the context that was desired, so what exactly is meant by the criticism that the Palmer quote is """"out of context""""? 
 :* I don't see why the Palmer quote is """"gratuitous"""". It provides motivation for chiropractic's early strong opposition to vaccination. We can't expect the casual reader to be familiar with this motivation. 
 :* I was originally opposed to putting the Kansas data in on the grounds that it wasn't published in a refereed journal, but Fyslee liked it on the grounds that it is a reliable source. Fyslee talked me into it so I put it in. I disagree that the Kansas data is """"cherry-picking""""; it's the most recent survey we have and its results are not hugely different from other surveys. However, it does appear to be two editors to one right now, so for now I removed it. We can revisit this issue if Fyslee chimes in again. 
 :* While it's true that statistics can be manipulated, these statistics (except for the Kansas data) are taken from reliable reviews, not from primary sources. When reliable reviews are reporting numbers, I don't see why the Wikipedia article should settle for vaguer statements. 
 :* As mentioned above the article could use reorganization, but that's a big project; for now many chiropractors do argue against the effectiveness of vaccines (unlike most other skeptics, who focus on safety) so this is the most plausible location for the material now.

 == What is and isn't a tribe? == 

 I think this article needs to better describe what a tribe actually means, and in particular what sorts of groups or societies are or are not tribes.  It also needs to better explain what the objections to using the word """"tribe"""" are.  I have a dictionary that defines the word tribe, but gives a caveat on the usage that:  
 :''In historical contexts the word tribe is broadly accepted ( ‘the area was inhabited by Slavic tribes’), but in contemporary contexts it is problematic when used to refer to a community living within a traditional society. It is strongly associated with past attitudes of white colonialists towards so-called primitive or uncivilized peoples living in remote undeveloped places. For this reason it is generally preferable to use alternative terms such as community or people. 
 However, I've also seen people object to the use of """"tribe"""" do describe such ancient societies, claiming """"they weren't tribes, they were kingdoms"""" (this was in reference to Germanic rather than Slavic tribes I think - I don't know if that makes any difference).  In summary, I'm unclear of the meaning of the word if """"tribe"""", and the objections to it are because: 
 :a) It is a meaningful word, but not considered """"politically correct"""" due to association with colonialist attitudes 
 :b) It is a meaningful word, but often gets misused to describe things that are not tribes

 :::::I still disagree with leaving the sentence as is. I have no issue with leaving the """"Austrian/Ron Paul type"""" label that Krugman uses to criticize Schiff, but Krugman is making a generalization here that leaves the reader no other interpretation than to accept Krugman's premise and conclusion. Because A, ergo B. If we use just the label """"economist"""" for Krugman and do not identify the branch of theory that he identifies with, it would give undue weight to his criticism of Schiff and his Austrian economic leanings because the lead for the Schiff article does not describe Schiff as a trained economist whereas Krugman is a professional economist writer. So to use the earlier analogy, if Krugman's view of the Austrian school can be boiled down to Because A, ergo B, then Austrians may view the Krugman premise as Because A, ergo C. In otherwords, Krugman says Austrians are wrong and Austrians view their position as correct. Hence, if we accept the disparaging context of Krugman's label and reproduce it verbatim in the Schiff article, it must be prefaced giving context to Krugman's self described leanings. To allay 's concern that Krugman does not consider himself a Keynesian, I performed a google search for """"krugman keynesian"""" and looking at several of the top five results would strongly imply that Krugman holds a Keynesian worldview. Here a couple that I was able to glean: I April 25, 2012 - The Big Wrong - """"And now the results are in: Keynesians have been completely right, Austerians utterly wrong — at vast human cost.""""  II April 25, 2012 - WHY AREN’T WE ALL KEYNESIANS YET? - """" I have often wondered why Keynes - unlike, say, Freud - has never become a pop cultural icon."""" I will reiterate this point again; since the Schiff article identifies John Maynard Keynes as an opponent of Schiff's, and since Krugman seems to identify with Keynes, ergo prefacing Krugman's criticism of Schiff and all the """"Austrian/Ron Paul types"""" by using the label """"Keynesian economist"""" is both descriptive and balanced. I see no evidence in wikipedia or wikitionary to show keynesian as a generally accepted derisive term; I can see that it may be derisive among those who hold an opposing economic view either as an adherrent to an opposing school or informally by not accepting Keynesian implications on government policies.

 ==legal fiction== 
 Concerning """"a legal fiction""""; were I the original author, I might choose to open the article with a tone less aggressive and more informative to the layperson. """"Legal fiction"""" is a term of art.  I don't believe it should be the """"definitional headline."""" It is; however, accurate.  Restatement (Second) of Torts §283 comment c (1965) (""""The reasonable man is a fictitious person, who is never negligent, and whose conduct is always up to standard."""")  In Vaughan v Menlove (1837) 132 ER 490 the """"legal fiction"""" is implied. First, when the jury was instructed that the defendant was required to have acted as a """"prudent man"""" would have acted under those circumstances.  And then under review, the directive was deemed too vague.  Further, it was determined that a defendant acting honstly and bona fide to the best of his own judgement would afford no rule at all and leave open infinitely variable individual judgement. Nuance aside, the foundation for the """"legal fiction"""" for the basis of comparison exists. The """"reasonable person"""" is a fact assumed or created by courts.    

 To eliminate the """"citation needed"""" might I suggest: 
 * Bedder v Director of Public Prosecutions [1954] 1 WLR 1119 (where """"reasonable man"""" is deemed a wholly impersonal fiction to which no special characteristic of the accused should be attributed) 
 * Camplin [1978] A.C. 705 (a reasonable man """"means an ordinary person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed of such powers of self control as everyone is entitled to expect that his fellow citizens will exercise in society as it is today"""") 
 * R v Smith (2000) 4 AER 289 (citing Champlin and Bedder: a preasonable man """"is a person having the power of self-control to be expected of an ordinary person of the sex and age of the accused, but in other respects sharing such of the accused's characteristics as they think would affect the gravity of the provocation to him; and that the question is not merely whether such a person would in like circumstances be provoked to lose his self-control but also whether he would react to the provocation as the accused did"""") 
 That said, I maintain that a citation is of modest benefit if not entirely unnecessary. From conceptual inception, the question has never been """"is the 'reasonable person' fictional?"""" I submit the question has always been, 'Is a reasonable person defined in accordance with a particular normative ethical commitment or in accordance with an empirically observed practice or perception?' I posit that a reasonable person, possessed of minimal education, should have little difficulty exploring the nature of """"legal fiction"""" (given the link) were they so inclined.

I prefer what scholars tell me, months afterwards, than what newspapers say in the heat of events. In the meantime we have our problem. But I think your objection to Thrylos's graph somewhat forced. Very many sources agree that June to November 4 marked an almost total shut-down of rocketing from Gaza. To insist on the whole lull period has an advantage, for the rockets at the end once added, make blur one's recognition of the demonstrated fact that, even if it is OR, between June and Nov.4, rocket attacks underwent a 95%+ reduction.

1404,"==Cleanup of the Criticims of feminism section== 

 As per the discussion in the discussion above on this topic, I went through this section and deleted counter-criticisms to the criticisms so that clarity is possible and to eliminate enmeshment.  I made NO judgements about ANY of the POV's of any counter-criticisms I cut and I mean NO Offense here.  I hope to see them ALL included in a section that is relevant such as maybe Responses to criticisms of feminism or whatever.  I cut them because they are completely irrelevant to the section as titled, because in some cases they completely buried the few short criticism statements themselves and because it is important to fully develop the criticisms, by themselves, before counter-criticising them if we are to understand these critisms at all. 
 
 I did add one little statement of (child abuse/parental abuse) content to one criticism because I happened, by coincidence, to have done the research for another article but I am not a member of that group, nor do I back that criticism as mine...I just saw it was relevant to that criticism and it may well need to be cut too unless THEY use it to back THEIR claims. 

 Finally, I tried to cleanup some tortured paragraphs by separating separate topics into new paragraphs, making it clear who was criticising in each PP and asking for specifics where I was confused as I read the content. 

 Again I hope to see the full scope of all criticisms and counter-criticisms included in this article with distint, complete and clear arguments.  This cleanup is in NO WAY meant to imply that any of these counter-arguments themselves were wrong or irrelevant...just that they do not belong in this section which is for the arguments against feminism themselves.   I welcome comments and suggestions about how to handle both criticisms and counter-criticisms in ways that the average wiki reader can read and comprehend easily, and that are complete, balanced, sourced and NPOV."

 == Ebony article? == 

 Does anyone have a citation to the 1990 Ebony article mentioned on this page?  A search of issues since 1989 (in an online database) turns up nothing that matches this description, and no 1990 articles that come at all close.  The reference was added by user Antares33712 at 20:19, 29 December 2005.  It's possible that my search results were incomplete, but it's also possible that the author misremembered the publication or the article details. 

 Because the current page accuses Ebony of printing misinformation (regarding Mariah Carey's race) and also suggests that the magazine article made other questionable claims, any mistake (either an inaccurate paraphrasing of an actual Ebony article, or a misattribution of someone else's article to Ebony) could be considered harmful to the magazine, and conceivably libellous.  I'm insufficiently familiar with Wikipedia's standards to take the step of removing it myself (I just added a """"fact"""" tag), but I wanted to call particular attention to the question in case others deem this the sort of thing that requires expedited action.  And of course, if someone does have a citation to add, or can correct any mistakes without deleting the entire reference, that would certainly be preferable!

The article I read didn't claim to be an overview of Eastern ideas of karma - but rather an application of them to theology. That's why it is imbued throughout with ideas from Western theology that do not fit well with Eastern ideas. 

 ::: So - if this material is included -it needs to be made clear where it comes from and what the discussion is - and given its proper context, and because the sources are articles by Western Christian theologians - at least the ones I followed up - that is another reason why it belongs in the Western section.

1427,"== French overtures to Japan, 1883-5 == 
 Hi , 

 Thanks for that interesting stuff you have dug out on French attempts to cosy up to Japan against China before and during the Sino-French War.  I'm going to search Albert Billot's L'affaire du Tonkin, the standard French diplomatic history of the Sino-French War, to see if he can add anything to your research. 

 What I would like to do eventually is merge your new section into the existing section 'China's fear of Japan', and probably cut it down a bit.  At the end of the day, France and Japan did not become allies, and I think it unbalances the main article to devote so much space to something that never happened.  On the other hand, I've long been wanting to create a new article, Diplomacy of the Sino-French War, and that would be the natural home for a discussion of French overtures to Japan.  I'll try to get round to it before long. 

 I'll get back to you after I've seen what Billot has to say on the subject. 

    

 P.S.  Nice photo you uploaded of French soldiers in Tonkin in 1888.

I remember vividly that in the past I used to think that all alt med is crap, quack and it was including cs. If at that time I would edit an article about cs, I would act in the same way as the above mentioned editors. That is why I find it easy for myself to understand their motives. None of them spent any time adding information from PUBMED positive articles about cs, but they have invested their time in finding sources that discredit cs. Due to my observation, almost all people who actually try cs change their opinion about it. That is why I'm of opinion, that if the above mentioned editors will try it, they are highly likely get a shift in their worldview regarding it. They will find it difficult to write """"has no effect for any condition"""", if they observed an actual effect on one of their conditions.   """

 On Sunday, March 11, the Washington Post published profiles written by Scott Wilson of two Israeli professors: Ilan Pappe and Benny Morris. The profile of Pappe, """"A Shared History, A Different Conclusion,"""" did not provide key context about why he is so reviled in Israel. 

 Ilan Pappe, a history lecturer at the University of Haifa, freely admits that, in his view, facts are irrelevant when it comes to the history of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. """"Indeed the struggle is about ideology, not about facts, Who knows what facts are? We try to convince as many people as we can that our interpretation of the facts is the correct one, and we do it because of ideological reasons, not because we are truthseekers,"""" Pappe said in an interview with the French newspaper Le Soir, Nov. 29, 1999. 

 Elsewhere, Pappe elaborated on his attitude toward historical investigation and academic objectivity: """"Historical Narratives . . . when written by historians involved deeply in the subject matter they write about, such as in the case of Israeli historians who write about the Palestine conflict, is motivated also...by a wish to make a point"""" (History News Network, April 5, 2004.) A more complete collection of Pappe's statements repudiating the value of historical facts is available here. 

 In light of Pappe's openness about his contemptuous view of scholarship, and his rejection of historical facts in favor of ideology, it is negligent that Scott Wilson's profile of him omits this key context. The piece portrayed the Haifa historian as a """"revisionist scholar"""" who languishes in """"nearly complete isolation"""" in Israel supposedly due to his alleged myth-busting research and political views, in which he opposes the existence of a Jewish state, even within its 1948 boundaries. For example, Wilson quotes without challenge Pappe's absurd allegation that """"My research debunked all of the lessons about Israel's creation that I had been raised on.""""   """

 The article says Zahara was born in 2011. The source for that contains no such information. This is important because Russell's mother said in trial testimony (punishment phase) that after the child was born, Katherine spent nearly 10 months at the family house, with Tsarnaev visiting mainly on the weekends. If this is true, it means that Russell was not present when the FBI interviewed Tsarnaev, and was likely not present in September 2011, when the Waltham murders happened; which of course reduces her potential culpability. If anybody has a direct source giving the date of birth of the child Zahara, they should add it, otherwise, the claim of 2011, however credible it may seem, should be removed as it is unsourced."

 1.WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system. It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries and monitoring and assessing health trends. 

 2.An infection is growth of pathogenic microorganisms in the body, whether or not body function is impaired. Someone with an STI will not necessarily have symptoms or signs that some kind of pathogen is in the body, and might not even feel sick. Someone with an STI can unknowing pass on an infection – if they do not have any signs or symptoms, they are probably not aware they are carrying an infection and may not take the proper precautions of protecting their partner. 

 3.Disease is any change from a state of health; impaired body function. The disease state is associated with the manifestation of symptoms such as fever, pain, aches etc., due to failure of immune system to control in the first round of the growth of infectious agent (s). 

  
 These people don't run around all day looking for euphemisms. The use of the word """"infection"""" instead of """"disease"""" is based on real data,on a real stigma, on a real definition. The main most important point being Someone with an STI will not necessarily have symptoms or signs that some kind of pathogen is in the body, and might not even feel sick.   

 Compare this with HIV and AIDS. Do we use both terms interchangeably? 

  
 It should be stated very clearly in the intro that an infection doesn't imply symptoms. Maybe then this article won't be completely fucking useless.

1569,"== Growth and dissolution eras == 

 The era classification in the History of the Ottoman Empire sidebox needs attention.  
 *The growth era is between 1453-1683. This means that the Ottoman Empire continued to grow in the 17th century. But it is not true. To be sure, Podolia and Crete were annexed. But  Anatolia, the core of the empire was in ruins. The empire was living the worst days as far as the public peace, cultural life and economy are considered. Vast areas in Caucasus and West Iran had been lost. The barbary states were almost independent. The reason the empire didn't disantegrate was the Thirty Years' War in Europe. The classical classification is better. The growth era must end by the end of the 16th century. (either by the death of Sokullu  Mehmet Pasha in 1579 or by the Peace of Zsitvatorok in 1606.) 
 *The dissolution era between 1908-1922 is quite meaningless. All Balkan countries (except Albania) and all African countries (except Libya) had already been lost by 1908 and the remainning territory was under the supervision of great powers of Europe. So I think the decline and dissolution must be treated together."

This month long discussion we are currently in, is the only serious discussion of changing the lead that has been proposed.  The language re: the number and names of the investigations was placed in the lead sometime in late 2006/2007. In September of 09, someone replaced that language with """"Oswald is the assassin"""", which instituted a discussion that lasted half a day.  I replaced that edit with the language that was there until Rudioso showed up about a month ago.  The point in relaying this history is that the edit history does not support that there has been some longstanding feud about the language of this introduction or that mentioning the investigations will somehow allow these discussion to continue.  In fact, the actual history tells us that the only time objections arise is when editors change it to state Oswald is the assassin.  Rudioso is the first and only editor who's objected to the statements of investigations since it's been introduced.  Now, I'm all for trying something new, but I think that since none of the proposals have garnered the support required to claim a new consensus it is best that we go back to what was there before Rudioso briefly objected.

 ::I find I have to agree with Teque. The introduction, for example, basically notes that some people have positive opinions of non-commercial dog food, and some people have negative opinions of commercial dog food. There is no point in either of those statements. The """"Commercial dog food"""" section appears to make a comparison of canned and dry food, where the facts in question are that dry food is cheaper, lasts longer, and is """"more convenient"""", and that canned food spoils faster but has a longer shelf life, and contains more protein on a dry matter basis. This isn't exactly appropriate, and all of these facts are mentioned again in the article, so this comparison seems intended to criminalize dry dog food. Further, the concept of """"dry matter"""" probably needs to be explained, as anyone who hasn't taken a Nutrition course is unlikely to know what that means. If you dried out wet dog food, and then— without the water weight— compared it on a gram to gram scale with dry dog food, yes, it would have more protein. However, a serving of wet food is mostly moisture, while a serving of dry dog food is mostly dry matter. So, as I understand, a dog gets a higher quantity of protein from a serving of dry food than a serving of wet food. I haven't added this to the article myself because I'm only repeating what I've been taught, I'm not intimately familiar with the subject. Moving on, in the """"Alternate dog food"""" sections, it is insinuated that commercial dog foods have no or significantly less nutritional value than alternate dog foods (freeze dried, I believe, to be specific); a more appropriate statement would possibly be that freeze dried foods retain more of their natural nutrients, while processed foods add nutrients back artificially. Next, the statement """"Many commercial dog foods are made from materials considered unusable or undesirable"""" is entirely opinionated. A statement that some ingredients can be unhealthy could be acceptable if backed by a citation of scientific research. Further, any list of """"contents"""" should not include only """"undesirable"""" ones. It should include all common ingredients. Otherwise, the list should be removed, as it draws focus to those specific ingredients. I just have to note, the only line in this section that suggests dry food has any value whatsoever is that expensive foods may contain """"suitable"""" ingredients. It's true that the cheapest brands have the quality of shoe leather, and any brand with adequate nutrition will be more expensive, but no note is made that the expensive food brands tend to be, nutritionally, very healthy for dogs. As well, there is mention of some of the less savory by products that are allowed into foods by AAFCO, but no mention of the nutritional requirements necessary to be AAFCO certified. I'm not saying that having cow brains in dog food is desirable, but it should also be noted that dog food must meet certain nutritional standards to be AAFCO certified. Generally, the difference is considered to be that between """"complete"""" and """"complete and balanced"""". A dog can survive on a solely complete diet, whereas a balanced diet is actually healthy (and necessary to be AAFCO certified). Interestingly, many prescription diets aren't AAFCO certified, because they will often deliberately reduce some kind of nutrient, like sodium. While this might have ill effects on a typical dog, it's more healthy for one having heart problems. On the same topic, under """"Labeling"""", AAFCO certification is disparaged. However, the only source for this is a person's opinion. The main point seems to be that AAFCO standards are worthless— whether or not they are, I couldn't say— but the point should be that the organization requires food to meet healthier standards. Next, a question— if there's an entire article on 2007 dog food recalls, is it necessary to go into such detail here? A more abridged form, like that used for """"past recalls"""", that directs readers to the separate article might be more appropriate. Overall, the article focuses on negatives of dry dog food and does not allow for the facts that some types of dry dog food are very healthy, that some types of wet food may be unhealthy, or that some alternate foods may not be healthy. Further, there is an over-reliance on this type of statement: """"Some argue..."""" """"Some maintain..."""" """"Proponents criticize..."""" """"Supporters believe..."""" """"Critics argue..."""" The majority of which, I'd like to note, promote negative opinions of dry dog food. Just because it is someone else's opinion, though, does not make it any less of an opinion. Most of these statements lack any support or citations, as well."""

 I've added a category of """"partial virtualization"""" between """"full virtualization"""" and """"paravirtualization"""". Although this may not sit well with everybody, I think we need a category for a system like IBM M44/44X – with virtual machines and multiple address spaces, but not full hardware simulation and the ability to boot multiple operating systems. There is a fuzzy line between such a system and any OS that provides address space isolation. Or rather there really is no such line, and all such operating systems could be considered in the same category. We wouldn't tend to view them as virtual machine systems today, but they were a huge step forward from earlier approaches to multitasking. Please feel free to butcher my addition if you see a better way to deal with this. I don't think we want to rewrite history based on today's categories however.  """

 ==EAAN== 
 You suggested several times that ID and EAAN are intimately related. You then blocked the discussion, so people can't dicuss the topic anymore. Because of this, I'm posting the arguments in you talk-page. Alternatively you could unlock the discussion page again, because to most people who understand EAAN the article is now in a dissatisfying condition and we'd like to discuss its improvement. 
  It seems there are two main arguments on your side: 
 :Plantinga presented the argument at Intelligent Design conferences (Creationism's Trojan Horse p269). 
 :It has been discussed in a book about ID and its critics. 
 Here is my response. 
 :# The argument is an argument against Naturalism given evolution. It can't be reformed to be an argument against evolution given naturalism, because as Plantinga says himself, """"for the naturalist evolution is the only game in town"""". James Beilby writes in his foreword to Plantingas Argument(Evolutionary Argument against Naturalism - Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism, 2002, p. vii)  """"Plantinga's argument should not be mistaken for an argument against evolutionary theory in general or, more specifically, against the claim that humans might have evolved from more primitive life forms. Rather, the purpose of his argument is to show that the denial of the existence of a creative deity is problematic. It is the conjunction of naturalism and evolution that suffers from the crippling deficiency of self-defeat, a deficiency not shared by the conjunction of theism and current evolutionary doctrine."""" The conclusion of the argument is interesting for any non-naturalist or theist (and may be presented at any conference concerning all sorts of theisms/deisms). But this doesn't relate the argumet more intimately to ID than any argument of natural theology. As a matter of fact, an ID proponent has a problem deploying the argument: if he convinces his naturalis friend of the truth of ID instead of evolution, he can't use EAAN anymore, since evolution is a premis of EAAN. 
 :#EAAN is in the book for the mentioned reasons. There is also a chapter on theistic evolution in the book. Yet, theistic evolution clearly isn't related to ID in the sense required by wikipedia. 
 :#Plantinga may or may not agree to evolution. He may even be a proponent of ID (which is not at all clear). But even if he was a fierce proponent of ID, this doesn't automatically relate all his work to ID. I have read quite a lot of Plantingas work (Knowledge of god, god and other minds, naturalism defeated, God, Freedom, and Evil, The Analytic Theist: An Alvin Plantinga Reader and some essays) and he never so much as mentions ID. ID is not present in his work and most notably EAAN is not related to ID, because it has evolution as its premise.  
 I hope to have convinced you that for the sake of the quality of wikipedia the ID passage and tag should be gone. If this is not enough, we'll have to let other people decide who's got the better arguments. 
 Thanks.  """

 ::Firstly, making up non existent words such as death crime or death defence to argue that death penalty is inappropriate word is spurious. In fact you are somewhat making my point.  You say capital punishment is tied to capital crime. """"Capital"""" denote ultimate or prime or ultimate, making reference to severity or significance. So it can refer to a city (London) as well as crime or penalty. """"Death"""" is a matter of fact reference to the content. For this reason, death city makes no sense. In reverse, death penalty is more matter of fact (NPOV) reference than capital punishment. Moreover, your claim that that """"We (American?) uniformely describe crimes elibigle for capital punishment as capital crimes"""". A simple google search shows that the claim of uniformality is not sustainable even in U.S.A. 

 ::Secondly, your made a claim in term of general usage. Therefore, google search with few millions sample is infintely more authoritative source than your sample (few entries dictionaries which subsequently equate DP and CP anyway). Even if we somewhat restrict ourselves to academic reference (which include legal dictionary or encycropedia), google scholar search, which make comprehensive search of academic papers, shows that death penalty is more common reference. You can also make few other type of search. Try using google news, which makes comprehensive reference to journalism. It shows overwhelming usage of death penalty over capital punishment. Or try using ask.com search which uses subject-specific link popularity to compute """"authoritativeness"""" of a search result. Again it shows that death penalty is more common reference.  Most top search for DP are from U.S as well. Capital punishment may be more common usage in sentencing which is a specific legal procedure in jurisprudence (which explain legal dictionary reference). This restcited context cannot be used to argue for commonality of usage of capital punishment both in public, journalism and academic world. This is another indication that DP is more NPOV than CP. Anyway, if you want to use few dictionaries entry as your evidence, feel free to do so. We appear to be heading to arbitration process. Consensus is prefered but not to the extent of filbuster. Ultimately, I don't have to convince the opposing advocate(s). I only have to convince the jury (arbitrator) that my case is more NPOV than yours. """

 == """"Mutual funds are regulated by the SEC, while hedge funds are not""""/regulation in general == 

 This is simply wrong.  Investment Advisers (the managers of hedge funds) in the US are governed by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  There are many aspects of the Act that apply both to registered and unregistered advisers.  The most important of these provisions are anti-fraud measures.  The SEC enforces the Act.   

 Registered IAs can count on a visit from the SEC on a schedule determined by the adviser/fund's perceived riskiness.  To try and draw some kind of distinction between an adviser being regulated and a fund being regulated is pointless: when the SEC visits, they are empowered to review all aspects of an adviser's funds. 

 The SEC can use Rule 206(4)-8 under the Act to come in and look at an unregistered adviser's funds, as well.   

 More, it is ludicrous to state that hedge funds are """"largely unregulated,"""" although this phrase is repeated in the popular press frequently.  In the US, hedge funds may be regulated by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, various SROs and exchanges, state securities regulators, the Department of Labor and maybe others.  In addition to the Act, hedge funds are regulated under the Investment Company Act (for exclusion from the definition of an Investment Company) and the Securities Act of 1933 (Regulation D  concerning sales of private securities).  Any trading by direct investment hedge funds is subject to all the rules of FINRA and the exchanges.   

 If anything, regulation in the UK is even stricter.  Solid regimes exist in other jurisdictions, including Cayman and Bermuda. 

 In short, it is the case in the US and the UK, among other major venues, that hedge funds are (highly) regulated pools of capital.

First, I am not sure there is a dispute to resolve.  The matter has been resolved and the decision is to not include Bill Ayers material to the article.  That a small vocal group repeatedly brings this up does not make it a real dispute.  If they continue to oppose a uniform consensus then dispute resolution becomes forum shopping.

Disclosure will take place in full adherence to the COI Guidelines. Prior to the ban it was our opinion that it was unclear whether or not COI disclosure was mandatory, and if it had been made known to us that it was mandatory and not an issue for debate, we would never have made previous edits contrary to the guidelines. Now that we know disclosure is mandatory, we have altered our practices to adhere to the new set of rules. I have reviewed the above proposals for how new forms of COI declarations could occur, and state here that WikiExperts is fully willing to work directly with the Community to develop a system of declarations that makes the Community comfortable and provides an additional level of neutral scrutiny for all our contributions. We will not be posting, and have not posted in the past, anything that is/was not meant to help develop a more accurate and better Wikipedia, and we are comfortable working with the Community to prove our work can be beneficial to Wikipedia. Because of previously signed NDAs, we have no ability to reveal the past clients, however, we pledge to no longer sign agreements that would disallow us from full COI disclosure, so that all future work can be verified as within Wikipedia policies and guidelines. The Ethics page on our website already states as such, and past references to confidentiality of the service have been removed. We would very much like to prove that we are not harmful to Wikipedia, and to show that we add neither promotional nor non-notable material to the website when allowed to edit.

 ==Reverted photo question== 

 Per your comment when your reverted my photo swap of File:AH-64D Apache Longbow 2006-7-6.JPG.  You asked  """"good faith, but why remove the only pic of the A in US Army for a so-so pic of a D?"""".  Here's my reasoning (was at the time): 
 *The A-model photo is in a section that is exclusively talking about D-models. 
 *The A-model photo is on an empty tarmac while the D-model photo was an in-flight combat photo 
 *The A-model photo was oriented away from the text, the D-model photo was oriented towards the text 
 I've moved the A-model photo up in the section, where the prose addresses the use of the A-model, and I've re-inserted the D-model photo back where it was.  That bumps out File:AH-64 Apache 060224.jpg, which is a large and sharper photo, but is a head-on view and does not show the more commonly seen perspective of the aircraft in flight.  I have other photos of the Longbow in flight that are higher resolution, but I will not post for OPSEC reasons.  Perhaps File:AH-64 Apache 060224.jpg could go back into the article under the """"D-Model"""" section, as there are no US D-Model photos, but rather two foreign (Isreal and Singapore) models.  I hope you agree to this reasoning and find my adjustments reasonable and logical.  I hope to work on cleaning up the article in general in the coming weeks. 

 Also, I have a question.  What would you think of using this file as an A-model photo? File:AH-64A at Fort Rucker Sep 1999.jpg.  I know that the pilot (myself) figures prominently, but it is a great photo of an AH-64A, and those just don't grow on trees any more.

 :It will confuse the merge if additional edits come in. Thanks.   
 ::No, I haven't stopped yet. But which merge do you mean? We can't merge the histories, so I'm unsure what merge means here.    
 :::not merge histories, but merge changes. I'm trying to merge the changes from the history article (using a 3-way merge), because edits/improvements were made since the branch in 2008. If you could just hold off it would help a great deal - I can't do the merge while someone else is editing. cheers 
 ::::I'm right in the middle of fixing the refs; can it wait until tomorrow? Also, I don't know what you mean by merging the changes. Do you mean you want to add some text to the history section from the former history article? If so, I'm going to rewrite and re-source that entire section (the ancient world section), because the sources aren't the best available. Or have I misunderstood?    
 :::::Yes; actually it would be easier to do now, before you make more changes. I'm trying to capture the differences from the history section, since it was written, since both versions evolved separately. It seems to stem from 2008, when it was moved to a new article; shortly thereafter, you copied the content back, but the split article remained, so the two versions evolved separated. A 3-way merge allows you to captures both sets of changes. See 3-way_merge#Three-way_merge for details. But making more changes, especially re-writes, will just confuse the merge process further.   
 :::::::I wrote the text that was moved to the history article. The additions since then were poorly sourced (e.g. to websites) and I can see factual errors, so they shouldn't be copied over. This is an academic subject, and it has to be based on largely (if not entirely) academic sources. There are plenty available, so there's no reason not to use them. My aim is to update the article to make sure the writing is improved, the sources are the best available, and that the text and the sources agree. Also, there are a few issues that we don't cover at all, or barely allude to, so I'd like to add those too. I can't do it overnight, though, because it's a protracted job.

 == totally wrong ==  

 I have deleted totally the following and I will explain why here.  

 [i]In the British-patterned universities, the Ph.D. program is much shorter because the coursework component is assigned to the masters' and bachelors' degrees, and the Ph.D. course is concerned purely with research for a thesis. The target time is nominally three years, but some students finish earlier, and many take a few years longer. The actual time depends strongly on the discipline being studied.[/i] 

 [b]This is rubbish for the reasons already discussed - while the funding councils are moving towards a model where they want applications to apply for Masters' funding and Ph.D. funding at the same time, there is no """"assignment"""" of coursework to the masters' - it's not actually a requirement to do a masters' before a Ph.D.[/b] 

 [i]British-style bachelors' degrees do not usually require a broad liberal arts and sciences general education component and students are therefore free to concentrate solely on their chosen discipline. The bachelors' degree, if conferred with a high level of 'honours' (i.e. excellent grades), can allow admission to a Ph.D. program without having to first write a masters' thesis. This route is only possible if the university offers an 'honours year' in the field of study, though this is becoming increasingly common due to the greater funding that universities receive for enrolling doctoral students.[/i] 

 This is complete rubbish from start to finish. I have never heard of a british university having a """"honours year"""" - virtually every degree awarded now in the UK has honours attached to it. In theory you can just walk after completing all of your modules and just get (for example) a BA but in practice everyone does their final assignment/project/disseration and gets their honours. The """"honours"""" bit is no indication of excellent grades - you can get a 2:2 and still graduate with a BA(Hons)!

1892,"== The Value of Half Rhyme == 

 This article doesn't mention the positive aspect or the value of half-rhyming or slant rhyming that would sometimes attract great poets including Yeats and others. Here are a few attractions of slant rhyme: First, it allows a poet to break away from what Milton complained about in rhyme, or the jingle-jangle of perfect rhymes. It allows the poet to use rhyme but with subtlety, and with the device itself being less assertive. Second, it makes available to the poet yet another tone or quality, a tone that is different, perhaps softer, and novel. Third, it offers the poet opportunities for irony and ironic humor when the rhyme makes an issue of the amount of distance it travels away from a perfect rhyme."

 == Dating the translation of Vattel  == 

 The article says: """"An English-language translation of Emerich de Vattel's 1758 treatise The Law of Nations..."""" That's OK, but it's important for clarifying the argument of those who want to make Vattel the controlling authority on the meaning of """"natural born citizen"""" that the English language translation of Vattel that appears in the article is from 1797 and that the 1787 First American Edition of Vattel (when the Federal Convention met) and those before it said something different: """"The natives, or indigenes, are those born in the country of parents who are citizens."""" There is no mention of """"natural-born citizen."""" 

 One way to deal with this is to simply change the article to say """"A 1797 English-language translation..."""" Need this be sourced? It's easy enough to tie the translation to 1797.  Google Books has the 1797 edition online. Sourcing the earlier translation online is a more difficult problem since we're now dealing with rare books.  """

 == Begging your pardon for all this... == 

 I have a complicated question. It is to me, at least.  

 So a froofraw has occurred at AN where  nominated dozens of nonfree images to be deleted for not complying with NFCC policy. I got into it because he tagged three images in articles I wrote. (These are the images: 1, 2, and 3) I feel rather certain that I fully justified the inclusion of these images based on my experience writing FAs and GAs. In fact, the third image there was included in a 2009 Featured contact Dispatch about how to write a fair use rationale. But now I get from the disjointed discussion that the issue of """"transformative use"""" is undecided and without consensus. According to those pushing for transformative use, a historical image has to be involved in the article, which qualifies for the historical images in Birmingham campaign, which I wrote.  

 I apologize because this is now so spread out I can't keep track of it anymore. There is the AN discussion here, an RfC about the issue of transformative use, which I can't even track it's so all over the place, and the discussions about each of the images that were tagged for deletion (start there and scroll down). 

 # I'm asking you if you can shed any light on this, specifically what I need to do to keep the images in the articles, because you have in the past treated intelligent editors looking to do the right thing with respect. I'm not seeing this in the other discussions. Not that I'm surprised. 
 # It's my contention that when other editors insist on bulky justification of images in article prose that does not reflect the weight of what sources say about the images, that that is a violation of WP:UNDUE and is a form of original research. I thinkand I'm not clear about what is being asked or demanded of methat a couple other editors are insisting that I make a section in the article about the image in order to keep it in the article. If, for example, three sources state that the image of Emmett Till's uncle is significant and they devote half a page in each book to how significant it is, but in the overall scheme of Emmett Till's story that is decreased to three sentences, would it not be OR to inflate how much prose is dedicated to the image?   
 # Why is the issue of what qualifies as fair use in images left up to consensus? Why haven't copyright attorneys taken this over? It seems if Wikipedia is doing something illegal or extralegal that there should be no questions about what qualifies as NFCC. I think part of why I'm so confused is that the editors insisting that the images be deleted are unsure of the legal literature themselves and have replaced clarity with force, pseudo-authority, and confusing language. Not that I'm surprised. 

 I learned how to justify images by being schooled by , who is semi-retired. He did pop into the FfD discussion for the Stonewall riots image to say that the """"transformative use"""" interpretation of the NFCC rule is """"a profound misunderstanding and misapplication of NFCC and sourcing policies"""". I'm not a copyright attorney. I can't parse all this. I just don't want the articles' qualities decreased because someone went on a deletion tear when none of the rules are clear.   """

 == Proposed change == 

 I have been making general observations regarding the article and expressing my opinion that it should be made more general, less technical, and focus exclusively on what global warming is, using wikilinks to other more detailed articles to address the role of the IPCC, various climatic models, and proposed corrective actions. This proposed lede was taken largely from the current article lede, just generalized and heavily trimmed. Is there any support among the editors for revising the article in the same manner?   

 Although the terms """"global warming"""" and """"global cooling"""" can be used to describe cyclic variations in global temperature, the term """"global warming"""" has been generally used since the mid-1970's to describe the current global warming event, which dates from the mid-1700's. Since the late 1800's, measured average global temperature has risen approximately 0.74°C(ref)NOAA Global Warming FAQ(/ref), and further warming is predicted by reputable scientific organizations including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.  

 Predicted impacts of global warming include: rising sea levels; changes in the amount and pattern of precipitation; an expansion of subtropical deserts; the retreat of glaciers; permafrost and sea ice; more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts and heavy rainfall events; species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes; and changes in agricultural yields. 

 The current rise in global temperatures has been fairly rapid, and is attributed in large part to the presence of human-produced greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although greenhouse gases can be produced by natural events (volcanos, for example), the vast majority of scientists believe that the additional human sources such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural activity have created an imbalance in the global temperature-regulation system, and that corrective actions to reduce those human sources should be taken. 
     

 :I don't like it, and it contains several claims that are either wrong, irrelevant, or misleading. First, the initial hedge (""""can be used"""") adds no useful information. Secondly, global warming is overwhelmingly used not to refer to warming since the mid 1700s, but for the mostly anthropogenic warming in the 20th and 21st century. The 0.74 is since the late 19th century - it's easy to misread """"late 1800's"""" as 1800. I'm not really happy by the """"warming is predicted by organizations"""" - many individual scientists do so as well. """"permafrost and sea ice"""" are not a predicted impact (changes to them are). """"Fairly rapid"""" is a very weak statement - as far as we know, it's extremely rapid. Also, if it's current, it should be """"is"""", not """"has been"""". I like the """"attributed in large part"""", but we should mention the rapid increase in human-produced greenhouse gases, not just their presence (they have been present, to some degree or other, for 200000 years). The natural sources of GHGs are a red herring here - the increase is clearly anthropogenic, and only a very small fringe thinks otherwise. I'm not to happy about the """"imbalance in the global temperature-regulation system"""" - what would that system be?  Finally, I would clearly separate the corrective actions from the recognition of anthropogenic warming - you will probably find all combinations (""""human-caused, no action"""" (I think Lombog now falls into that group), """"human caused, action"""" (many there), """"not human-caused, no action"""" (strict deniers), and even """"not human caused, action anyways"""" (e.g. from people who are concerned about energy resources).

 No problem, I think though the new rewording sounds a lot better and is more iinformative and I can see your points regarding the data being more suitable to be added to the depersonalisation article. Sorry if I got carried away. I usually do keep my cool on wikipedia. I think the triggering of DPD is like where someone gets really stoned either a s aonce off or a period of use or takes LSD or psylocibin a couple of times or once and then triggers depersonalisation disorder. I guess I am coming from the perspective or depersonalisation caused by a chronic insult to the nervous system, i.e. severe distortion of brain chemistry due to chronic dependence (upregulation, down regulation of transmitter systems) and/or from withdrawal. For example I have never heard of someone going and getting drunk and then waking up the next day with (triggered) depersonalisation or some other major mental health disorder but I have heard and it is well known that alcohol dependence and misuse over a prolonged period of time can cause a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Infact I was talking to a psychiatrist and he said that the most common causes of depersonalisation like symptoms that he sees in his practice is either from cannabis or the consequences of alcoholism and he says as far as alcoholism he has seen people recover after up to 10 years of abstinence or in some cases never. He works with a lot of people who have mental health problems from drug abuse and/or dependence. There is no ill feeling at all from my point of view.

 I believe Kennedy wore a red tie during the debate with Nixon which was said to have a positive psychological impact on those who viewed the debate.

This website is dedicated only to export of Bamboo and Cane made Handicraft from North Eastern India , which is well known all over the world for its excellent quality bamboo and cane. North East Handicraft Product , a company formed in the year 2010 by Mr. Manoranjan Das with Mr. Shakti Das based in Bangalore has been very successful in making the people aware of handicraft use and how it help us to save the environment. Catering only to Indian people we came out with a idea that we should focus on worldwide about the benefits of handicraft and how it help us to serve for a noble cause , we started SHAKTI EXPORT. Initially we will concentrate on small products and gradually launch the large products like Sofa Set , Bed etc made of Bamboo and Cane. However we will also export products for other companies whenever required as we have a tie up with excellent shipment / courier companies here in India. 

 We have our own production unit manufacturing Bamboo and Cane Handicrafts. 80 percent unskilled and 20 percent unskilled is the ratio of our work force. As this hand made products are made by the village people in the interior area which are their source of income , we do the marketing and present their beautiful products worldwide where-by it help the people to earn a livelihood. 

 Presently we have tie up with 10 plus online partner companies which sell this hand made products online. As we ventured into export business now we have been working hard to present it before the international market. 
  	  

 1. The bamboo and cane used for production are solely from the  dense forest of North- East.

In fact registration of a birth has nothing to do with attribution of U.S. nationality, or for that matter, British nationality (given the facts of parentage and the birth of a parent in Britain). A certification of birth is an entitlement (under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child) and under New York and Federal law.

The tax issue is more complex: there is an exit tax, quite onerous for """"covered expatriates""""  generally speaking those with assets over $2 million or an tax bill of $155,000 (as of 2013).
