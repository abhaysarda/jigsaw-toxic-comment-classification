 == Final draft… maybe == 
 This will go on the evolutionary ethics page. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_ethics, it will go after the section called """"Further reading""""  

 Evolutionary ethics struggles as a system of normative ethics, which asks the question """"what should I do?"""" It struggles due to the logical fallacy of turning a statement about what is, into one about what we ought to do (see naturalistic fallacy). As a meta-ethical theory, one that tells us the nature of moral judgments, evolutionary ethics can be used as a decent descriptor on why we have certain views on right and wrong. As a meta-ethical claim it does not tell us what is right and wrong, but rather that the origin of our ethical practices come from our evolutionary history. This tends to lead to a less black and white view on ethical beliefs and leaves much more room for gray areas.   

 Many philosophers who support this view of evolutionary meta-ethics use it to undermine Aristotelian teleology, a belief that we can't reduce things to the parts that compose them, but the end they are trying to achieve is very important. At times evolutionary ethics is used to undermine moral realism, a view that morals are objectively true and do not rely upon a person’s thoughts or attitudes. However other philosophers still use evolution to champion moral realism. Often they will argue that there is a set of moral truths and that our behavior naturally tend towards moral truths because of evolution. 

 More often however, it is used to support moral subjectivism. This is a belief that moral truths are subjective and often times based on cultural norms, thoughts, and attitudes towards a subject matter rather than a set of mind-independent truths. Evolutionary ethics assumes we have a set of basic underlying morals, such as not killing another person. This stems from the evolutionary need to allow the species to survive. Then some of the more graininess of ethics comes from the differences in cultural upbringings and backgrounds, and thus the finer points of ethics would be considered subjective.

 == Please resist the urge to spin == 

 As a gay gamer who has been playing video games since the 1976 Fairchild, I can say that I have been FAR from impressed with the representation of gay identity in video gaming. I can tolerate ridiculous stereotypical depictions of gay folk, but what is worse is the systematic censorship. Classifying mere gay identity as """"mature/sexual/adult"""" is one way of enabling retailers like Wal-Mart to de-gay their shelves and content creators to de-gay their products, citing sales concerns. It is patently discriminatory to act as if being openly gay is """"more sexual"""" than being openly hetero, yet people blithely accept this double-standard all the time. 

 While there isn't much news coverage to be found about this, the Christian Right is driving quite a bit of this. Their scare tactics routinely include trying to convince parents that gays are after their children. Having openly gay characters in video games, especially when they're not villains and fools, is a threat to their system of using us as pawns in their quest for power. 

 The Sims proved people wrong who declared """"only hetero males play video games"""". Besides, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy to make products designed to appeal to the taste of one demographic and proclaim that others simply have no interest in gaming in the first place. It's quite convenient. How much of this dearth of gay content (and I don't mean token content) is due to the fact that most developers are heterosexual men? 

 So, please resist the urge to spin the history of gays-in-gaming as being much rosier than it is. Even The Sims titles censor us, making us """"convert"""" people into homosexuals (a very offensive thing to force a gay person to do, let me tell you) and force characters into romantic interactions. A token non-foolish non-evil gay character here and there does not equate to an industry in which people like myself truly feel there are products that are non-narrow. And, frankly, the phrase """"the pink dollar"""" itself is rather offensive. The money I earn is green. When I touch it it doesn't transform due to """"the gay"""". Historically-minded folks may also want to remember that pink was the color for boys and blue was the color for girls in the 19th century. I would hope that developers will start seeing an end to heterosexism and homophobia as being more about creative freedom than cash.""",0

 Hi. Regarding your edits to 1% (South Park), please do not rearrange the plot summary, as there is no reason for A-plot and B-plot to be summarized separately. Care should be taken to provide them in a way that mirrors how they occurred concurrently as much as possible. Also 

 *""""Fifth Graders"""" is not a proper noun. 
 *""""This incites Butters and Jimmy, and an angry group of Fifth Graders with an idea"""" is wrong. Butters and Jimmy came up with one idea, and the fifth graders came up with a different one. 
 *Regarding the passage """"Despite being at Token's house, mistaking a concerned Stan, Kyle, and Kenny as the killers, the real killer manages to get inside and proceeds to put Muscle Man Marc in boiling water. Finding Rumper Tumpskin, Cartman is forced to watch his toy's head blown off by the culprit, Cartman's doll Polly Prissypants. """" two points: First, it is only necessary to summarize the plot. All we need to inform the reader is that more of Cartman's toys are being destroyed. We do not need to emphasize specific details about the mutilations. This is why the previous summary is more streamlined. Second, you mention Rumper Tumpskin and Muscle Man Marc, without explain who or what they are. Given the number of varied non-human and fantasy characters that appear in the series, you can't assume that readers know who these people are. This is another reason why just saying, """"Despite being at Token's house, Cartman discovers Muscle Man Marc and Rumper Tumpskin, two more of his toys, destroyed, with the remaining one, a doll named Polly Prissypants, sitting in an armchair with a revolver, claiming responsibility for all the toy 'murders'."""" is simpler and better.

 == Taxobox removal == 

 I removed the taxobox. The article seems to be about a common name that refers to most (or all) species of two cetacean families.   

 :This was reverted here, with the edit summary Revert - information in infobox takes this into account, provides useful information. Dolphin is a common name for some species of the two families, not a single scientific taxon. The article explains this fact, I would not remove """"useful information"""". The specious inclusion is very misleading, it is best explained in the article. What reliable source would state it refers to these two taxa, when some of them have the common name of whale? Why should the taxobox be used for an article about a non systematic name?   

 ::I wouldn't  have a problem with having two families in the taxobox, except that under current taxonomy this one is now incorrect.  I am not concerned about the fact that some dolphins have a common name of """"whale"""", since most authoritative sources would recognize those species dolphin species despite the common name, since all are in Delphinidae.  But the problem is that the River Dolphins have now been split into multiple families, so just using """"Delphinidae and Platanistoidea"""" is no longer correct.  And rather than include five families in the taxobox, which becomes somewhat spurious, it seems better to remove the taxobox and discuss the taxonomy in the article.    

 :::What if the family section is just left out? Or be given a note like """"See article""""? I like the infobox and it does provide useful data and a basic glance at where dolphins fit in in the animal kingdom (it never fails to amaze me how many people do not seem to realise dolphins are mammals!). Looking at some other articles, there's no consensus on the infobox usage. The whale article has no infobox for example, while many others such as the shark, lizard or turtle articles do have them.    

 ::I have a problem with original research being used in our document. This would include basing a taxon on a common name, there is no concordance between common names and biological nomenclature. A reader comes here to acquire facts, those few who do not know they are mammals can gain that information from the content proper of the article. The two families, or even five, are not given an accepted taxon; the fact that some reliable sources (also!) name some of the species as Dolphins is incidental, not authoritative. Everyone likes the taxobox, let us be careful with our names here most of all, it is not an infobox. I appreciate that the undue weight given to other names appended to the correct name may cause this misapprehension, but the consensus is that a taxobox should summarise a single taxon and be included in only one article. Whale is without one for reasons that are intimately linked with this article's title. The other examples you have given are [hopefully] given in RS that state, unequivocally, a common name refers to a taxon: """"Sharks (superorder Selachimorpha)""""; """"Lizards (Suborder: Lacertilia) are a very large and widespread group of reptiles of the order Squamata"""" [highly debatable, but still a single taxon]; and superorder Chelonia (turtles) is yet another reptilian (Sauropsida) example that needed resolving. Removing duplicated or specious (spurious) taxoboxes is never popular with those who had a notion to include them, I'm not sure why, but it is certain to be the right path for clarifying explanations to our dear readers. An article on the common name 'dolphin' is justified, it could be more than a dab, but it is not a taxon. Please undo the unfounded revert of my edit.   

 :::All dolphins belong to the suborder of Odontoceti, every animal mentioned in this article does, so the taxobox """"tree"""" is correct (especially considering my last edit) - so no incorrect data is given in the box.

I don't think I need to mention it because it's totally irrelevant how many people oppose something. It does NOT count how many are on which side, it counts what is behind: arguments and truth. With your lies and will to mislead people by depicting the game as something it is not, you're runnining against a wall of truth and arguments and I'll make sure you won't tear that wall down, no matter if you're a biased AA players or a biased admin on the site. I'm right, and you know that very well. And even if you are in the majority, this rule remains true: """"Something is still right, even if everyone thinks it's not. Something is wrong even if everyone thinks it's right."""" You don't EVEN think you're right, you just pretend! Knock off your pathetic pretence for I only accept the truth, and the truth only.

Search the official forum for the word """"propaganda"""", you'll find nothing. """"Many""""? What a liar you are. You represent not """"many"""" players, you'll represent ONE.

 """"The game America's Army, the propagame as I will call it, is unique in its being."""" 

 """" From advergame to propagame """" 

 """"The message America's Army sends itself is propagandistic. It propagandises a certain kind of lifestyle message in which the army would like the participant to join and become. Propaganda itself has a history within religion. Religion also sends the same message, to let the participant (or the participant in becoming) join and become the religion (so sending the message of religion). So America's Army, with its governmental background, is instead of an advergame, better to be described as a propagame."""" 

 BETTER TO BE DESCRIBED AS A PROPAGAME. What did I say? PRIMARILY fits the definition of propaganda. =>Authority argument (university) underscores my version. 

 """"When it comes to the propagame America's Army, the next quotation is striking: 
 """"The initial success of America's Army has exceeded the Army's expectations, and Colonel Wardynski and his design team are excited about the possibilities. """"We're going to be pushing out new versions of the game as fast as we can build them,"""" he says. """"This same team will be building missions, weapons, and new features for years to come."""" The nation's youth can expect a lot more from their friendly army of one.""""( 'America's Army' Targets Youth by Jacob Hodes & Emma Ruby Sachs)"""" 

 """" From the analysis of the advergame and the striking resemblance I have described with the propagame America's Army I will now turn my attention to the consequences for communication on Internet by such games."""" 

 """" The exception is America's Army because it communicates itself as a company in which citizens can join. The aim is to let the gamers themselves join the company as an employee and be the producers within of the message the army sends. One of the aims of advergames is to construct a process of viral marketing, but this is done unlike the propagame. The advergame aims that consumers virally communicate about the game or the message it beholds for the purpose of spreading the word, but not to become one with the company itself. DaimlerChrysler for example wouldn't make a game in which one is being trained to become the director of a car factory (this would create competition). Not yet (emphasised), but maybe in the future it will when one seeks for employees."""" 

 """"I thus called it a propagame: a game that propagandises a message to become the message. Within the game, gamers are disciplined and the power structures are like the common army power structure: top down hierarchical.""""

1247,"""* He opposes the role of women in preaching roles, opposes abortion rights, and believes that homosexuality is a sin.  This sentence is technically true as written, but could probably be made more NPOV by changing the phrase """"abortion rights"""" to """"abortion"""", like so: He opposes the role of women in preaching roles, opposes abortion, and believes that homosexuality is a sin.  Reasoning:  The use of the phrase """"abortion rights"""" of necessity implies a right to abortion, and demonizes Mohler by casting him in the role of opposing a fundamental human right.  While it can most certainly be argued this is true, Mohler's own argument (and that of the entire pro-life movement) is that abortion is not a fundamental human right, it is murder.

 Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Thai domestic passenger ticket.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here. 

 Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.  

 If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """""""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

Apparently this is not the context that was desired, so what exactly is meant by the criticism that the Palmer quote is """"out of context""""? 
 :* I don't see why the Palmer quote is """"gratuitous"""". It provides motivation for chiropractic's early strong opposition to vaccination. We can't expect the casual reader to be familiar with this motivation. 
 :* I was originally opposed to putting the Kansas data in on the grounds that it wasn't published in a refereed journal, but Fyslee liked it on the grounds that it is a reliable source. Fyslee talked me into it so I put it in. I disagree that the Kansas data is """"cherry-picking""""; it's the most recent survey we have and its results are not hugely different from other surveys. However, it does appear to be two editors to one right now, so for now I removed it. We can revisit this issue if Fyslee chimes in again. 
 :* While it's true that statistics can be manipulated, these statistics (except for the Kansas data) are taken from reliable reviews, not from primary sources. When reliable reviews are reporting numbers, I don't see why the Wikipedia article should settle for vaguer statements. 
 :* As mentioned above the article could use reorganization, but that's a big project; for now many chiropractors do argue against the effectiveness of vaccines (unlike most other skeptics, who focus on safety) so this is the most plausible location for the material now.

 == What is and isn't a tribe? == 

 I think this article needs to better describe what a tribe actually means, and in particular what sorts of groups or societies are or are not tribes.  It also needs to better explain what the objections to using the word """"tribe"""" are.  I have a dictionary that defines the word tribe, but gives a caveat on the usage that:  
 :''In historical contexts the word tribe is broadly accepted ( ‘the area was inhabited by Slavic tribes’), but in contemporary contexts it is problematic when used to refer to a community living within a traditional society. It is strongly associated with past attitudes of white colonialists towards so-called primitive or uncivilized peoples living in remote undeveloped places. For this reason it is generally preferable to use alternative terms such as community or people. 
 However, I've also seen people object to the use of """"tribe"""" do describe such ancient societies, claiming """"they weren't tribes, they were kingdoms"""" (this was in reference to Germanic rather than Slavic tribes I think - I don't know if that makes any difference).  In summary, I'm unclear of the meaning of the word if """"tribe"""", and the objections to it are because: 
 :a) It is a meaningful word, but not considered """"politically correct"""" due to association with colonialist attitudes 
 :b) It is a meaningful word, but often gets misused to describe things that are not tribes

 :::::I still disagree with leaving the sentence as is. I have no issue with leaving the """"Austrian/Ron Paul type"""" label that Krugman uses to criticize Schiff, but Krugman is making a generalization here that leaves the reader no other interpretation than to accept Krugman's premise and conclusion. Because A, ergo B. If we use just the label """"economist"""" for Krugman and do not identify the branch of theory that he identifies with, it would give undue weight to his criticism of Schiff and his Austrian economic leanings because the lead for the Schiff article does not describe Schiff as a trained economist whereas Krugman is a professional economist writer. So to use the earlier analogy, if Krugman's view of the Austrian school can be boiled down to Because A, ergo B, then Austrians may view the Krugman premise as Because A, ergo C. In otherwords, Krugman says Austrians are wrong and Austrians view their position as correct. Hence, if we accept the disparaging context of Krugman's label and reproduce it verbatim in the Schiff article, it must be prefaced giving context to Krugman's self described leanings. To allay 's concern that Krugman does not consider himself a Keynesian, I performed a google search for """"krugman keynesian"""" and looking at several of the top five results would strongly imply that Krugman holds a Keynesian worldview. Here a couple that I was able to glean: I April 25, 2012 - The Big Wrong - """"And now the results are in: Keynesians have been completely right, Austerians utterly wrong — at vast human cost.""""  II April 25, 2012 - WHY AREN’T WE ALL KEYNESIANS YET? - """" I have often wondered why Keynes - unlike, say, Freud - has never become a pop cultural icon."""" I will reiterate this point again; since the Schiff article identifies John Maynard Keynes as an opponent of Schiff's, and since Krugman seems to identify with Keynes, ergo prefacing Krugman's criticism of Schiff and all the """"Austrian/Ron Paul types"""" by using the label """"Keynesian economist"""" is both descriptive and balanced. I see no evidence in wikipedia or wikitionary to show keynesian as a generally accepted derisive term; I can see that it may be derisive among those who hold an opposing economic view either as an adherrent to an opposing school or informally by not accepting Keynesian implications on government policies.

 ==legal fiction== 
 Concerning """"a legal fiction""""; were I the original author, I might choose to open the article with a tone less aggressive and more informative to the layperson. """"Legal fiction"""" is a term of art.  I don't believe it should be the """"definitional headline."""" It is; however, accurate.  Restatement (Second) of Torts §283 comment c (1965) (""""The reasonable man is a fictitious person, who is never negligent, and whose conduct is always up to standard."""")  In Vaughan v Menlove (1837) 132 ER 490 the """"legal fiction"""" is implied. First, when the jury was instructed that the defendant was required to have acted as a """"prudent man"""" would have acted under those circumstances.  And then under review, the directive was deemed too vague.  Further, it was determined that a defendant acting honstly and bona fide to the best of his own judgement would afford no rule at all and leave open infinitely variable individual judgement. Nuance aside, the foundation for the """"legal fiction"""" for the basis of comparison exists. The """"reasonable person"""" is a fact assumed or created by courts.    

 To eliminate the """"citation needed"""" might I suggest: 
 * Bedder v Director of Public Prosecutions [1954] 1 WLR 1119 (where """"reasonable man"""" is deemed a wholly impersonal fiction to which no special characteristic of the accused should be attributed) 
 * Camplin [1978] A.C. 705 (a reasonable man """"means an ordinary person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed of such powers of self control as everyone is entitled to expect that his fellow citizens will exercise in society as it is today"""") 
 * R v Smith (2000) 4 AER 289 (citing Champlin and Bedder: a preasonable man """"is a person having the power of self-control to be expected of an ordinary person of the sex and age of the accused, but in other respects sharing such of the accused's characteristics as they think would affect the gravity of the provocation to him; and that the question is not merely whether such a person would in like circumstances be provoked to lose his self-control but also whether he would react to the provocation as the accused did"""") 
 That said, I maintain that a citation is of modest benefit if not entirely unnecessary. From conceptual inception, the question has never been """"is the 'reasonable person' fictional?"""" I submit the question has always been, 'Is a reasonable person defined in accordance with a particular normative ethical commitment or in accordance with an empirically observed practice or perception?' I posit that a reasonable person, possessed of minimal education, should have little difficulty exploring the nature of """"legal fiction"""" (given the link) were they so inclined.

 As per the discussion in the discussion above on this topic, I went through this section and deleted counter-criticisms to the criticisms so that clarity is possible and to eliminate enmeshment.  I made NO judgements about ANY of the POV's of any counter-criticisms I cut and I mean NO Offense here.  I hope to see them ALL included in a section that is relevant such as maybe Responses to criticisms of feminism or whatever.  I cut them because they are completely irrelevant to the section as titled, because in some cases they completely buried the few short criticism statements themselves and because it is important to fully develop the criticisms, by themselves, before counter-criticising them if we are to understand these critisms at all. 
 
 I did add one little statement of (child abuse/parental abuse) content to one criticism because I happened, by coincidence, to have done the research for another article but I am not a member of that group, nor do I back that criticism as mine...I just saw it was relevant to that criticism and it may well need to be cut too unless THEY use it to back THEIR claims. 

 Finally, I tried to cleanup some tortured paragraphs by separating separate topics into new paragraphs, making it clear who was criticising in each PP and asking for specifics where I was confused as I read the content. 

 Again I hope to see the full scope of all criticisms and counter-criticisms included in this article with distint, complete and clear arguments.  This cleanup is in NO WAY meant to imply that any of these counter-arguments themselves were wrong or irrelevant...just that they do not belong in this section which is for the arguments against feminism themselves.

 Does anyone have a citation to the 1990 Ebony article mentioned on this page?

The reference was added by user Antares33712 at 20:19, 29 December 2005.  It's possible that my search results were incomplete, but it's also possible that the author misremembered the publication or the article details. 

 Because the current page accuses Ebony of printing misinformation (regarding Mariah Carey's race) and also suggests that the magazine article made other questionable claims, any mistake (either an inaccurate paraphrasing of an actual Ebony article, or a misattribution of someone else's article to Ebony) could be considered harmful to the magazine, and conceivably libellous.  I'm insufficiently familiar with Wikipedia's standards to take the step of removing it myself (I just added a """"fact"""" tag), but I wanted to call particular attention to the question in case others deem this the sort of thing that requires expedited action.

 Hi , 

 Thanks for that interesting stuff you have dug out on French attempts to cosy up to Japan against China before and during the Sino-French War.  I'm going to search Albert Billot's L'affaire du Tonkin, the standard French diplomatic history of the Sino-French War, to see if he can add anything to your research. 

 What I would like to do eventually is merge your new section into the existing section 'China's fear of Japan', and probably cut it down a bit.  At the end of the day, France and Japan did not become allies, and I think it unbalances the main article to devote so much space to something that never happened.  On the other hand, I've long been wanting to create a new article, Diplomacy of the Sino-French War, and that would be the natural home for a discussion of French overtures to Japan.  I'll try to get round to it before long.

 -'Because the hotel has infinite rooms, we can move any guest occupying any room n to room n+1, then fit the newcomer into room 1'. 
 No, we can't. Room n+1 is already occupied, as are all rooms by definition. Any room in the hotel has 'occupied' as descriptor, as per condition of the problem (' a hypothetical hotel with a countably infinite number of rooms, all of which are occupied '). So, whatever number we call any particular room (be it n+1, n+2, n+3 or any other), it does not change the room's 'occupied' status.

The sanction is in effect immediately, as is indicated by Armstrong's inability to participate in officially sanctioned triathlons.  The UCI needs to ratify nothing.

 On Sunday, March 11, the Washington Post published profiles written by Scott Wilson of two Israeli professors: Ilan Pappe and Benny Morris. The profile of Pappe, """"A Shared History, A Different Conclusion,"""" did not provide key context about why he is so reviled in Israel. 

 Ilan Pappe, a history lecturer at the University of Haifa, freely admits that, in his view, facts are irrelevant when it comes to the history of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. """"Indeed the struggle is about ideology, not about facts, Who knows what facts are? We try to convince as many people as we can that our interpretation of the facts is the correct one, and we do it because of ideological reasons, not because we are truthseekers,"""" Pappe said in an interview with the French newspaper Le Soir, Nov. 29, 1999. 

 Elsewhere, Pappe elaborated on his attitude toward historical investigation and academic objectivity: """"Historical Narratives . . . when written by historians involved deeply in the subject matter they write about, such as in the case of Israeli historians who write about the Palestine conflict, is motivated also...by a wish to make a point"""" (History News Network, April 5, 2004.) A more complete collection of Pappe's statements repudiating the value of historical facts is available here. 

 In light of Pappe's openness about his contemptuous view of scholarship, and his rejection of historical facts in favor of ideology, it is negligent that Scott Wilson's profile of him omits this key context. The piece portrayed the Haifa historian as a """"revisionist scholar"""" who languishes in """"nearly complete isolation"""" in Israel supposedly due to his alleged myth-busting research and political views, in which he opposes the existence of a Jewish state, even within its 1948 boundaries. For example, Wilson quotes without challenge Pappe's absurd allegation that """"My research debunked all of the lessons about Israel's creation that I had been raised on.""""   """,0
1521,"== Zahara == 

 The article says Zahara was born in 2011. The source for that contains no such information. This is important because Russell's mother said in trial testimony (punishment phase) that after the child was born, Katherine spent nearly 10 months at the family house, with Tsarnaev visiting mainly on the weekends. If this is true, it means that Russell was not present when the FBI interviewed Tsarnaev, and was likely not present in September 2011, when the Waltham murders happened; which of course reduces her potential culpability. If anybody has a direct source giving the date of birth of the child Zahara, they should add it, otherwise, the claim of 2011, however credible it may seem, should be removed as it is unsourced.",0

 1.WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system. It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries and monitoring and assessing health trends. 

 2.An infection is growth of pathogenic microorganisms in the body, whether or not body function is impaired. Someone with an STI will not necessarily have symptoms or signs that some kind of pathogen is in the body, and might not even feel sick. Someone with an STI can unknowing pass on an infection – if they do not have any signs or symptoms, they are probably not aware they are carrying an infection and may not take the proper precautions of protecting their partner. 

 3.Disease is any change from a state of health; impaired body function. The disease state is associated with the manifestation of symptoms such as fever, pain, aches etc., due to failure of immune system to control in the first round of the growth of infectious agent (s). 

  
 These people don't run around all day looking for euphemisms. The use of the word """"infection"""" instead of """"disease"""" is based on real data,on a real stigma, on a real definition. The main most important point being Someone with an STI will not necessarily have symptoms or signs that some kind of pathogen is in the body, and might not even feel sick.   

 Compare this with HIV and AIDS. Do we use both terms interchangeably? 

  
 It should be stated very clearly in the intro that an infection doesn't imply symptoms. Maybe then this article won't be completely fucking useless.

But  Anatolia, the core of the empire was in ruins. The empire was living the worst days as far as the public peace, cultural life and economy are considered. Vast areas in Caucasus and West Iran had been lost. The barbary states were almost independent. The reason the empire didn't disantegrate was the Thirty Years' War in Europe. The classical classification is better. The growth era must end by the end of the 16th century. (either by the death of Sokullu  Mehmet Pasha in 1579 or by the Peace of Zsitvatorok in 1606.) 
 *The dissolution era between 1908-1922 is quite meaningless. All Balkan countries (except Albania) and all African countries (except Libya) had already been lost by 1908 and the remainning territory was under the supervision of great powers of Europe.

Rudioso is the first and only editor who's objected to the statements of investigations since it's been introduced.  Now, I'm all for trying something new, but I think that since none of the proposals have garnered the support required to claim a new consensus it is best that we go back to what was there before Rudioso briefly objected.  That version clearly had consensus, something that no new proposal has garnered.

 This website has been debated time and time again. It has been removed after much debate spanning over 2 years. There have been many reasons stated for and against this web sites inclusion. But the reasons for its removal was best summed up with  comments 
 :the intellexual.net review is unsigned and is published on what appears to be an unknown individual's personal web site, its subject was a technologically unremarkable product which is long defunct and whose performance may bear little relation to that of its successors, and it discusses the product in a gleefully negative framework that is anything but neutral and unbiased and is thus of dubious value as an encyclopedic link [..] Besides, if that stale and biased review is the most credible link that we skeptics can come up with, I'd say that's pretty sad.   
 So please don't link this site its POV it lacks verifiability and is tested on a particular product not made by Bose since the late 90's.    

 :Yes, but you don't write the rules. There is no wiki rule that says that objective measurements have to be signed, or calibrated, so the comments about the frequency remain. If you can find objective measurements of a Bose system that are more to your liking, please post them. Personally I thought my summary of that page was uncontroversial.

 :Hey ! Yes, I supported both because I see instances on which these two might be used. The main difference is that the first proposal is aimed at autoconfirmed users (Use PC2 instead of blocking them, since semiprotection wouldn't work) and the second does not differentiate any use types (applies to all users, and is used as a substitute to full protection). So, I support both because I see PC2 as a plausible solution in many instances where content creation cannot be delayed in spice of having socks or autoconfirmed users edit warring or something.

 ::I find I have to agree with Teque. The introduction, for example, basically notes that some people have positive opinions of non-commercial dog food, and some people have negative opinions of commercial dog food. There is no point in either of those statements. The """"Commercial dog food"""" section appears to make a comparison of canned and dry food, where the facts in question are that dry food is cheaper, lasts longer, and is """"more convenient"""", and that canned food spoils faster but has a longer shelf life, and contains more protein on a dry matter basis. This isn't exactly appropriate, and all of these facts are mentioned again in the article, so this comparison seems intended to criminalize dry dog food. Further, the concept of """"dry matter"""" probably needs to be explained, as anyone who hasn't taken a Nutrition course is unlikely to know what that means. If you dried out wet dog food, and then— without the water weight— compared it on a gram to gram scale with dry dog food, yes, it would have more protein. However, a serving of wet food is mostly moisture, while a serving of dry dog food is mostly dry matter. So, as I understand, a dog gets a higher quantity of protein from a serving of dry food than a serving of wet food. I haven't added this to the article myself because I'm only repeating what I've been taught, I'm not intimately familiar with the subject. Moving on, in the """"Alternate dog food"""" sections, it is insinuated that commercial dog foods have no or significantly less nutritional value than alternate dog foods (freeze dried, I believe, to be specific); a more appropriate statement would possibly be that freeze dried foods retain more of their natural nutrients, while processed foods add nutrients back artificially. Next, the statement """"Many commercial dog foods are made from materials considered unusable or undesirable"""" is entirely opinionated. A statement that some ingredients can be unhealthy could be acceptable if backed by a citation of scientific research. Further, any list of """"contents"""" should not include only """"undesirable"""" ones. It should include all common ingredients. Otherwise, the list should be removed, as it draws focus to those specific ingredients. I just have to note, the only line in this section that suggests dry food has any value whatsoever is that expensive foods may contain """"suitable"""" ingredients. It's true that the cheapest brands have the quality of shoe leather, and any brand with adequate nutrition will be more expensive, but no note is made that the expensive food brands tend to be, nutritionally, very healthy for dogs. As well, there is mention of some of the less savory by products that are allowed into foods by AAFCO, but no mention of the nutritional requirements necessary to be AAFCO certified. I'm not saying that having cow brains in dog food is desirable, but it should also be noted that dog food must meet certain nutritional standards to be AAFCO certified. Generally, the difference is considered to be that between """"complete"""" and """"complete and balanced"""". A dog can survive on a solely complete diet, whereas a balanced diet is actually healthy (and necessary to be AAFCO certified). Interestingly, many prescription diets aren't AAFCO certified, because they will often deliberately reduce some kind of nutrient, like sodium. While this might have ill effects on a typical dog, it's more healthy for one having heart problems. On the same topic, under """"Labeling"""", AAFCO certification is disparaged. However, the only source for this is a person's opinion. The main point seems to be that AAFCO standards are worthless— whether or not they are, I couldn't say— but the point should be that the organization requires food to meet healthier standards. Next, a question— if there's an entire article on 2007 dog food recalls, is it necessary to go into such detail here? A more abridged form, like that used for """"past recalls"""", that directs readers to the separate article might be more appropriate. Overall, the article focuses on negatives of dry dog food and does not allow for the facts that some types of dry dog food are very healthy, that some types of wet food may be unhealthy, or that some alternate foods may not be healthy. Further, there is an over-reliance on this type of statement: """"Some argue..."""" """"Some maintain..."""" """"Proponents criticize..."""" """"Supporters believe..."""" """"Critics argue..."""" The majority of which, I'd like to note, promote negative opinions of dry dog food. Just because it is someone else's opinion, though, does not make it any less of an opinion. Most of these statements lack any support or citations, as well.""",0

There is a fuzzy line between such a system and any OS that provides address space isolation. Or rather there really is no such line, and all such operating systems could be considered in the same category. We wouldn't tend to view them as virtual machine systems today, but they were a huge step forward from earlier approaches to multitasking.

 I have made some small changes to the Christian view section:

To include it here might imply that the dates encompass all Ecumenical Councils, which is incorrect, as even the Eastern Orthodox accept 8 Ecumenical Councils, though there is disagreement about the identity of the 8th Council. 
 *I have reworded the Jesus-Trinity passage, mainly including the word Hypostases since the word person can be problematic nowadays (this also provides a prelude to the later word """"hypostatic union""""), and shifting the link to """"Trinity"""". The article formerly talked about """"a doctrine known as the Holy Trinity"""", when the Trinity is not a doctrine.  
 *I have also reworded the """"two natures"""" passage, starting with the one person and then stating the two natures. I have also reworded it so that it clearly says that there is one fully human and one fully divine nature - the former wording seemed to say that Jesus had two natures that both were human AND divine.

 ==EAAN== 
 You suggested several times that ID and EAAN are intimately related. You then blocked the discussion, so people can't dicuss the topic anymore. Because of this, I'm posting the arguments in you talk-page. Alternatively you could unlock the discussion page again, because to most people who understand EAAN the article is now in a dissatisfying condition and we'd like to discuss its improvement. 
  It seems there are two main arguments on your side: 
 :Plantinga presented the argument at Intelligent Design conferences (Creationism's Trojan Horse p269). 
 :It has been discussed in a book about ID and its critics. 
 Here is my response. 
 :# The argument is an argument against Naturalism given evolution. It can't be reformed to be an argument against evolution given naturalism, because as Plantinga says himself, """"for the naturalist evolution is the only game in town"""". James Beilby writes in his foreword to Plantingas Argument(Evolutionary Argument against Naturalism - Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism, 2002, p. vii)  """"Plantinga's argument should not be mistaken for an argument against evolutionary theory in general or, more specifically, against the claim that humans might have evolved from more primitive life forms. Rather, the purpose of his argument is to show that the denial of the existence of a creative deity is problematic. It is the conjunction of naturalism and evolution that suffers from the crippling deficiency of self-defeat, a deficiency not shared by the conjunction of theism and current evolutionary doctrine."""" The conclusion of the argument is interesting for any non-naturalist or theist (and may be presented at any conference concerning all sorts of theisms/deisms). But this doesn't relate the argumet more intimately to ID than any argument of natural theology. As a matter of fact, an ID proponent has a problem deploying the argument: if he convinces his naturalis friend of the truth of ID instead of evolution, he can't use EAAN anymore, since evolution is a premis of EAAN. 
 :#EAAN is in the book for the mentioned reasons. There is also a chapter on theistic evolution in the book. Yet, theistic evolution clearly isn't related to ID in the sense required by wikipedia. 
 :#Plantinga may or may not agree to evolution. He may even be a proponent of ID (which is not at all clear). But even if he was a fierce proponent of ID, this doesn't automatically relate all his work to ID. I have read quite a lot of Plantingas work (Knowledge of god, god and other minds, naturalism defeated, God, Freedom, and Evil, The Analytic Theist: An Alvin Plantinga Reader and some essays) and he never so much as mentions ID. ID is not present in his work and most notably EAAN is not related to ID, because it has evolution as its premise.  
 I hope to have convinced you that for the sake of the quality of wikipedia the ID passage and tag should be gone. If this is not enough, we'll have to let other people decide who's got the better arguments. 
 Thanks.  """,0

 ::Firstly, making up non existent words such as death crime or death defence to argue that death penalty is inappropriate word is spurious. In fact you are somewhat making my point.  You say capital punishment is tied to capital crime. """"Capital"""" denote ultimate or prime or ultimate, making reference to severity or significance. So it can refer to a city (London) as well as crime or penalty. """"Death"""" is a matter of fact reference to the content. For this reason, death city makes no sense. In reverse, death penalty is more matter of fact (NPOV) reference than capital punishment. Moreover, your claim that that """"We (American?) uniformely describe crimes elibigle for capital punishment as capital crimes"""". A simple google search shows that the claim of uniformality is not sustainable even in U.S.A. 

 ::Secondly, your made a claim in term of general usage. Therefore, google search with few millions sample is infintely more authoritative source than your sample (few entries dictionaries which subsequently equate DP and CP anyway). Even if we somewhat restrict ourselves to academic reference (which include legal dictionary or encycropedia), google scholar search, which make comprehensive search of academic papers, shows that death penalty is more common reference. You can also make few other type of search. Try using google news, which makes comprehensive reference to journalism. It shows overwhelming usage of death penalty over capital punishment. Or try using ask.com search which uses subject-specific link popularity to compute """"authoritativeness"""" of a search result. Again it shows that death penalty is more common reference.  Most top search for DP are from U.S as well. Capital punishment may be more common usage in sentencing which is a specific legal procedure in jurisprudence (which explain legal dictionary reference). This restcited context cannot be used to argue for commonality of usage of capital punishment both in public, journalism and academic world. This is another indication that DP is more NPOV than CP. Anyway, if you want to use few dictionaries entry as your evidence, feel free to do so. We appear to be heading to arbitration process. Consensus is prefered but not to the extent of filbuster. Ultimately, I don't have to convince the opposing advocate(s). I only have to convince the jury (arbitrator) that my case is more NPOV than yours. """,0

 == """"Mutual funds are regulated by the SEC, while hedge funds are not""""/regulation in general == 

 This is simply wrong.  Investment Advisers (the managers of hedge funds) in the US are governed by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  There are many aspects of the Act that apply both to registered and unregistered advisers.  The most important of these provisions are anti-fraud measures.  The SEC enforces the Act.   

 Registered IAs can count on a visit from the SEC on a schedule determined by the adviser/fund's perceived riskiness.  To try and draw some kind of distinction between an adviser being regulated and a fund being regulated is pointless: when the SEC visits, they are empowered to review all aspects of an adviser's funds. 

 The SEC can use Rule 206(4)-8 under the Act to come in and look at an unregistered adviser's funds, as well.   

 More, it is ludicrous to state that hedge funds are """"largely unregulated,"""" although this phrase is repeated in the popular press frequently.  In the US, hedge funds may be regulated by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, various SROs and exchanges, state securities regulators, the Department of Labor and maybe others.  In addition to the Act, hedge funds are regulated under the Investment Company Act (for exclusion from the definition of an Investment Company) and the Securities Act of 1933 (Regulation D  concerning sales of private securities).

Disclosure will take place in full adherence to the COI Guidelines. Prior to the ban it was our opinion that it was unclear whether or not COI disclosure was mandatory, and if it had been made known to us that it was mandatory and not an issue for debate, we would never have made previous edits contrary to the guidelines. Now that we know disclosure is mandatory, we have altered our practices to adhere to the new set of rules. I have reviewed the above proposals for how new forms of COI declarations could occur, and state here that WikiExperts is fully willing to work directly with the Community to develop a system of declarations that makes the Community comfortable and provides an additional level of neutral scrutiny for all our contributions. We will not be posting, and have not posted in the past, anything that is/was not meant to help develop a more accurate and better Wikipedia, and we are comfortable working with the Community to prove our work can be beneficial to Wikipedia. Because of previously signed NDAs, we have no ability to reveal the past clients, however, we pledge to no longer sign agreements that would disallow us from full COI disclosure, so that all future work can be verified as within Wikipedia policies and guidelines. The Ethics page on our website already states as such, and past references to confidentiality of the service have been removed.

For example, someone added """"Lanix has seen sustained growth since 2005"""", and that Lanix has the 3rd or 4th largest market share in Latin America's consumer electronics sector. If you could find sources that support such assertions, those would really help determine notability.

 Per your comment when your reverted my photo swap of File:AH-64D Apache Longbow 2006-7-6.JPG.  You asked  """"good faith, but why remove the only pic of the A in US Army for a so-so pic of a D?"""".  Here's my reasoning (was at the time): 
 *The A-model photo is in a section that is exclusively talking about D-models. 
 *The A-model photo is on an empty tarmac while the D-model photo was an in-flight combat photo 
 *The A-model photo was oriented away from the text, the D-model photo was oriented towards the text 
 I've moved the A-model photo up in the section, where the prose addresses the use of the A-model, and I've re-inserted the D-model photo back where it was.  That bumps out File:AH-64 Apache 060224.jpg, which is a large and sharper photo, but is a head-on view and does not show the more commonly seen perspective of the aircraft in flight.  I have other photos of the Longbow in flight that are higher resolution, but I will not post for OPSEC reasons.  Perhaps File:AH-64 Apache 060224.jpg could go back into the article under the """"D-Model"""" section, as there are no US D-Model photos, but rather two foreign (Isreal and Singapore) models.  I hope you agree to this reasoning and find my adjustments reasonable and logical.  I hope to work on cleaning up the article in general in the coming weeks. 

 Also, I have a question.  What would you think of using this file as an A-model photo? File:AH-64A at Fort Rucker Sep 1999.jpg.  I know that the pilot (myself) figures prominently, but it is a great photo of an AH-64A, and those just don't grow on trees any more.

 :It will confuse the merge if additional edits come in. Thanks.   
 ::No, I haven't stopped yet. But which merge do you mean? We can't merge the histories, so I'm unsure what merge means here.    
 :::not merge histories, but merge changes. I'm trying to merge the changes from the history article (using a 3-way merge), because edits/improvements were made since the branch in 2008. If you could just hold off it would help a great deal - I can't do the merge while someone else is editing. cheers 
 ::::I'm right in the middle of fixing the refs; can it wait until tomorrow? Also, I don't know what you mean by merging the changes. Do you mean you want to add some text to the history section from the former history article? If so, I'm going to rewrite and re-source that entire section (the ancient world section), because the sources aren't the best available. Or have I misunderstood?    
 :::::Yes; actually it would be easier to do now, before you make more changes. I'm trying to capture the differences from the history section, since it was written, since both versions evolved separately. It seems to stem from 2008, when it was moved to a new article; shortly thereafter, you copied the content back, but the split article remained, so the two versions evolved separated. A 3-way merge allows you to captures both sets of changes. See 3-way_merge#Three-way_merge for details. But making more changes, especially re-writes, will just confuse the merge process further.   
 :::::::I wrote the text that was moved to the history article. The additions since then were poorly sourced (e.g. to websites) and I can see factual errors, so they shouldn't be copied over. This is an academic subject, and it has to be based on largely (if not entirely) academic sources. There are plenty available, so there's no reason not to use them. My aim is to update the article to make sure the writing is improved, the sources are the best available, and that the text and the sources agree. Also, there are a few issues that we don't cover at all, or barely allude to, so I'd like to add those too. I can't do it overnight, though, because it's a protracted job.

 == totally wrong ==  

 I have deleted totally the following and I will explain why here.  

 [i]In the British-patterned universities, the Ph.D. program is much shorter because the coursework component is assigned to the masters' and bachelors' degrees, and the Ph.D. course is concerned purely with research for a thesis. The target time is nominally three years, but some students finish earlier, and many take a few years longer. The actual time depends strongly on the discipline being studied.[/i] 

 [b]This is rubbish for the reasons already discussed - while the funding councils are moving towards a model where they want applications to apply for Masters' funding and Ph.D. funding at the same time, there is no """"assignment"""" of coursework to the masters' - it's not actually a requirement to do a masters' before a Ph.D.[/b] 

 [i]British-style bachelors' degrees do not usually require a broad liberal arts and sciences general education component and students are therefore free to concentrate solely on their chosen discipline. The bachelors' degree, if conferred with a high level of 'honours' (i.e. excellent grades), can allow admission to a Ph.D. program without having to first write a masters' thesis. This route is only possible if the university offers an 'honours year' in the field of study, though this is becoming increasingly common due to the greater funding that universities receive for enrolling doctoral students.[/i] 

 This is complete rubbish from start to finish. I have never heard of a british university having a """"honours year"""" - virtually every degree awarded now in the UK has honours attached to it. In theory you can just walk after completing all of your modules and just get (for example) a BA but in practice everyone does their final assignment/project/disseration and gets their honours. The """"honours"""" bit is no indication of excellent grades - you can get a 2:2 and still graduate with a BA(Hons)!

It allows the poet to use rhyme but with subtlety, and with the device itself being less assertive. Second, it makes available to the poet yet another tone or quality, a tone that is different, perhaps softer, and novel.

 The article says: """"An English-language translation of Emerich de Vattel's 1758 treatise The Law of Nations..."""" That's OK, but it's important for clarifying the argument of those who want to make Vattel the controlling authority on the meaning of """"natural born citizen"""" that the English language translation of Vattel that appears in the article is from 1797 and that the 1787 First American Edition of Vattel (when the Federal Convention met) and those before it said something different: """"The natives, or indigenes, are those born in the country of parents who are citizens."""" There is no mention of """"natural-born citizen.""""

 == Begging your pardon for all this... == 

 I have a complicated question. It is to me, at least.  

 So a froofraw has occurred at AN where  nominated dozens of nonfree images to be deleted for not complying with NFCC policy. I got into it because he tagged three images in articles I wrote. (These are the images: 1, 2, and 3) I feel rather certain that I fully justified the inclusion of these images based on my experience writing FAs and GAs. In fact, the third image there was included in a 2009 Featured contact Dispatch about how to write a fair use rationale. But now I get from the disjointed discussion that the issue of """"transformative use"""" is undecided and without consensus. According to those pushing for transformative use, a historical image has to be involved in the article, which qualifies for the historical images in Birmingham campaign, which I wrote.  

 I apologize because this is now so spread out I can't keep track of it anymore. There is the AN discussion here, an RfC about the issue of transformative use, which I can't even track it's so all over the place, and the discussions about each of the images that were tagged for deletion (start there and scroll down). 

 # I'm asking you if you can shed any light on this, specifically what I need to do to keep the images in the articles, because you have in the past treated intelligent editors looking to do the right thing with respect. I'm not seeing this in the other discussions. Not that I'm surprised. 
 # It's my contention that when other editors insist on bulky justification of images in article prose that does not reflect the weight of what sources say about the images, that that is a violation of WP:UNDUE and is a form of original research. I thinkand I'm not clear about what is being asked or demanded of methat a couple other editors are insisting that I make a section in the article about the image in order to keep it in the article. If, for example, three sources state that the image of Emmett Till's uncle is significant and they devote half a page in each book to how significant it is, but in the overall scheme of Emmett Till's story that is decreased to three sentences, would it not be OR to inflate how much prose is dedicated to the image?   
 # Why is the issue of what qualifies as fair use in images left up to consensus? Why haven't copyright attorneys taken this over? It seems if Wikipedia is doing something illegal or extralegal that there should be no questions about what qualifies as NFCC. I think part of why I'm so confused is that the editors insisting that the images be deleted are unsure of the legal literature themselves and have replaced clarity with force, pseudo-authority, and confusing language. Not that I'm surprised. 

 I learned how to justify images by being schooled by , who is semi-retired. He did pop into the FfD discussion for the Stonewall riots image to say that the """"transformative use"""" interpretation of the NFCC rule is """"a profound misunderstanding and misapplication of NFCC and sourcing policies"""".

 == Proposed change == 

 I have been making general observations regarding the article and expressing my opinion that it should be made more general, less technical, and focus exclusively on what global warming is, using wikilinks to other more detailed articles to address the role of the IPCC, various climatic models, and proposed corrective actions. This proposed lede was taken largely from the current article lede, just generalized and heavily trimmed. Is there any support among the editors for revising the article in the same manner?   

 Although the terms """"global warming"""" and """"global cooling"""" can be used to describe cyclic variations in global temperature, the term """"global warming"""" has been generally used since the mid-1970's to describe the current global warming event, which dates from the mid-1700's. Since the late 1800's, measured average global temperature has risen approximately 0.74°C(ref)NOAA Global Warming FAQ(/ref), and further warming is predicted by reputable scientific organizations including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.  

 Predicted impacts of global warming include: rising sea levels; changes in the amount and pattern of precipitation; an expansion of subtropical deserts; the retreat of glaciers; permafrost and sea ice; more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts and heavy rainfall events; species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes; and changes in agricultural yields. 

 The current rise in global temperatures has been fairly rapid, and is attributed in large part to the presence of human-produced greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Although greenhouse gases can be produced by natural events (volcanos, for example), the vast majority of scientists believe that the additional human sources such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural activity have created an imbalance in the global temperature-regulation system, and that corrective actions to reduce those human sources should be taken. 
     

 :I don't like it, and it contains several claims that are either wrong, irrelevant, or misleading. First, the initial hedge (""""can be used"""") adds no useful information. Secondly, global warming is overwhelmingly used not to refer to warming since the mid 1700s, but for the mostly anthropogenic warming in the 20th and 21st century. The 0.74 is since the late 19th century - it's easy to misread """"late 1800's"""" as 1800. I'm not really happy by the """"warming is predicted by organizations"""" - many individual scientists do so as well. """"permafrost and sea ice"""" are not a predicted impact (changes to them are). """"Fairly rapid"""" is a very weak statement - as far as we know, it's extremely rapid. Also, if it's current, it should be """"is"""", not """"has been"""". I like the """"attributed in large part"""", but we should mention the rapid increase in human-produced greenhouse gases, not just their presence (they have been present, to some degree or other, for 200000 years). The natural sources of GHGs are a red herring here - the increase is clearly anthropogenic, and only a very small fringe thinks otherwise. I'm not to happy about the """"imbalance in the global temperature-regulation system"""" - what would that system be?  Finally, I would clearly separate the corrective actions from the recognition of anthropogenic warming - you will probably find all combinations (""""human-caused, no action"""" (I think Lombog now falls into that group), """"human caused, action"""" (many there), """"not human-caused, no action"""" (strict deniers), and even """"not human caused, action anyways"""" (e.g. from people who are concerned about energy resources).

 No problem, I think though the new rewording sounds a lot better and is more iinformative and I can see your points regarding the data being more suitable to be added to the depersonalisation article. Sorry if I got carried away. I usually do keep my cool on wikipedia. I think the triggering of DPD is like where someone gets really stoned either a s aonce off or a period of use or takes LSD or psylocibin a couple of times or once and then triggers depersonalisation disorder. I guess I am coming from the perspective or depersonalisation caused by a chronic insult to the nervous system, i.e. severe distortion of brain chemistry due to chronic dependence (upregulation, down regulation of transmitter systems) and/or from withdrawal. For example I have never heard of someone going and getting drunk and then waking up the next day with (triggered) depersonalisation or some other major mental health disorder but I have heard and it is well known that alcohol dependence and misuse over a prolonged period of time can cause a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Infact I was talking to a psychiatrist and he said that the most common causes of depersonalisation like symptoms that he sees in his practice is either from cannabis or the consequences of alcoholism and he says as far as alcoholism he has seen people recover after up to 10 years of abstinence or in some cases never. He works with a lot of people who have mental health problems from drug abuse and/or dependence. There is no ill feeling at all from my point of view.

The tax issue is more complex: there is an exit tax, quite onerous for """"covered expatriates""""  generally speaking those with assets over $2 million or an tax bill of $155,000 (as of 2013). There are also other tax implications relating to gifts and estates. There is a concession for persons born to alien parents who renounce by age 18-1.2: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/877  

 It is quite possible to be a non-citizen  even to have been deported as an illegal alien  and still be liable for U.S. tax, perhaps indefinitely, Indeed long-term green-card holders are also subject to the exit tax system.

 This one is tricky because both sides have valid points.  I need to hunt down references to support it but I undestand the Southern argument that the house was in such a commanding position that it really was not suitable as a hospital, and putting a hospital flag on it to prevent if from being used that way was unacceptable.  On the other hand the lack of attention to defending it suggests that Mulligan's intentions were that it would be sufficiently in the rear that it would be a good site.  My personal interpretation is that he or someone before him miscalculated and assumed that there would not be any force chosing to place itself between there and the river.  At any rate, I see both sides as having merit.

 :::::""""Group selection isn’t widely accepted by evolutionists for several reasons. First, it’s not an efficient way to select for traits, like altruistic behavior, that are supposed to be detrimental to the individual but good for the group. Groups divide to form other groups much less often than organisms reproduce to form other organisms, so group selection for altruism would be unlikely to override the tendency of each group to quickly lose its altruists through natural selection favoring cheaters. Further, we simply have little evidence that selection on groups has promoted the evolution of any trait. Finally, other, more plausible evolutionary forces, like direct selection on individuals for reciprocal support, could have made us prosocial.

 Hrmm, 3 paragraphs for VSU, 7 against. This seems a little biased. I'll try and beef up the pro side if I know the zealots won't delete it. 

  

 how many universities would be effected by Federal enactment of VSU?   

 All of the publicly owned ones (ie. not Bond or ACU;): to my knowledge, there's not a single public uni in Australia where student organisation membership is currently optional.   

 ==Motivations of the ALSF== 

 The article states (or should state): 

 *Liberal Students argue strongly for VSU on the basis of freedom of association and other grounds; 
 *They deny the charge that they are arguing for VSU on the basis of political disadvantage for their opponents; 
 *VSU advocates on the other hand consistently and routinely accuse Liberals of  supporting the change for political motivations. 

 I will undo any changes to the article that do not substantially agree with this situation, as it is simply a matter of objective fact, favouring no particular side.   

 ===== 

 I don't know why you are bringing so much politics into this.  

 """"Liberal Students argue strongly for VSU on the basis of freedom of association and other grounds"""" 

 Thats a very big blanket statement. So you are saying Liberal Students, as a whole, fit your reasoning? You can't possibly know that unless you have questioned every one. Thats what I'm objecting to. FYI I'm not a liberal, and wish Latham had won. I do support freedom of choice. 

 By the way, I apoligize for the 'commie' remark. 

 :That's perfectly alright. Politics plays a very large part in this: it is a point of conflict over the government's legislation after all, and was debated by both sides in the House of Representatives and the Senate when it came up, with the Liberals arguing in favour of VSU and Labor arguing in favour of USU. At the last election, the ALP's policy supported USU and the Coalition supported VSU. 

 ::Yes, but you are missing my point. I objected to the blanket language that implied that _all_ students who identified as X thought Y.   

 :And the """"freedom of choice"""" argument really only appears because some students argue that they should be free to choose not to support the politics of their student organisation.  

 ::Hang on, I don't follow you here. Personally I think that Student Unions should stay out of politics not directly relating to education. Even if the unions didn't play politican, I still would support VSU. If some students want bands, clubs, so-called subsidised food etc, they should pay for it themselves. The """"Freedom of Choice"""" argument still applies even if you ignore the political side of things.  

 By contrast, if a Liberal group gained control of a USU supporter's student organisation, that USU supporter would still not argue in favour of VSU because they still support USU philosophically (as indeed has happened at a few campuses). So the """"freedom of choice"""" argument is underlined by differences in political opinion. If there was no objection to the political content, the advocates wouldn't be arguing the need to make the choice. 

 :: I disagree. See above. 

  
 :The point is, I'm not taking a stand one way or the other over whether Liberals *are* supporting it for political motivations, I'm saying that USU supporters *say* that Liberals are supporting it for political motivations (Many sources for this: virtually every NUS press release argues this point).  If, as you say, you're not a Liberal, this clearly doesn't apply to you. The article mentions that VSU supporters deny this claim. NPOV policy simply requires that we detail the substance of both sides' arguments without putting a judgement on their validity.

 == Is the """"Kifu"""" recording system used to record Shogi games? == 

 Kifu is the system for recording games of Go.  Since pieces never move in Go once placed on the board, Kifu records a game by drawing a diagram of the board in the end position and numbering each piece to show on which move it was placed.  The Kifu topic page was included in category Shogi, and said that it was also used for Shogi, but I see nothing on this page about it and I don't see how it would be applicable to a game where the pieces move about. 

 I've removed all references to Shogi on the Kifu page, but on the off-chance that it is in some way connected I'm leaving this request for more info here.  Maybe Kifu is Japanese for """"game record"""" or something and is a general term used by Shogi players?  If it is relevant please update the Kifu page and its talk page accordingly, and the Shogi page as well; if it isn't please confirm here?  Thanks.   """,

 As I stated in the previous RfC about Michael Lucas's biography, manufacturer PR material about a product is generally acceptable as an encyclopedic source.  If editors who disagree with the company position find evidence to the contrary in other published sources that meet WP:V - such as a film review in an established magazine or newspaper - then that opinion may be cited alongside the manufacturer statement.  While it may be possible that the film producers cited the public domain novel instead of the copyrighted film for legal reasons, it would violate WP:NOR to advance that view without a verifiable source for the claim and it would violate WP:NPOV to exclude the production company's position.

2143,"The connection with the stopped watch is that in both cases there's a solution that works only if you ask the question for which it (the watch, or the simple solution) produces the correct answer.  It's like using Pythagoras' theorem to determine the length of the third side of a 6-8-X triangle without saying anything about whether the triangle is a right triangle.  Yes, X is 10 if the triangle is a right triangle, but Pythagoras' theorem only applies if the triangle is a right triangle, so unless it's given that the triangle is a right triangle or you can somehow show the triangle must be a right triangle based on what's given, using Pythagoras' theorem is unjustified.  Similarly, showing that the unconditional probability of winning by switching is 2/3 for the MHP (which is what the simple solutions do) when asked about the conditional probability is not a complete answer unless you also say something about why these two probabilities must be the same.

 The first problem relates to the main event in the life of the Buddha, namely, Parivraja. Why did the Buddha take Parivraja? The traditional answer is that he took Parivraja because he saw a dead person, a sick person and an old person. This answer is absurd on the face of it. The Buddha took Parivraja at the age of 29. If he took Parivraja as a result of these three sights, how is it he did not see these three sights earlier? These are common events occurring by hundreds, and the Buddha could not have failed to come across them earlier. It is impossible to accept the traditional explanation that this was the first time he saw them. The explanation is not plausible and does not appeal to reason. But if this is not the answer to the question, what is the real answer?

 republican is the type of person who is a part of the ignorant of the masses, and really is not doing anything for the good of the country. They think that they are the """"patriotic ones"""", but is killing the innocent a patriotic idea? Are usually pro-life people but support the death penalty and for no reason, being in Iraq and being responsible for the death of the innocent. Like George Dubya Bush, and think turning the USA into Big Brother's house is the path of succes for America. These people should be considered dangerous and stuipd, and should be tried for crimes against humanity, integration of church and state, and violations to the US Constitution. 

  
 A RepubliCon is someone who, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, is able to manipulate large, vapid, weak-minded audiences by means of manipulation, deception, distortion of facts, and incomplete information. He is a con-artist with an inability to think objectively, consider alternatives, and allow for dissention. A RepubliCon appeals to intellectually conservative, mindless and often dimwitted followers. These followers are regressive lemmings who will follow the RepubliCon’s faithfully regardless of the inevitably tragic conclusion. I cannot understand how those RepubliCon's like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly can charge up their audiences when they are clearly passing their subjective, distorted views as fact. —Preceding unsigned comment added by

I see people cite to WP:CRYSTAL, but that, of course, doesn't specifically address filmographies, so it's a much more generalized and fluid concept and ultimately a judgment call. Some even cite to WP:NFF,even though it's a notability guideline, for the notion that if you can't have a film article about a film that isn't in production, you can't have an entry in a film table, either. Not altogether satisfying as someone may always point out that notability doesn't affect content, just creation. 

 :I keep thinking that if I search hard enough, I'll find something, but the closest I came was a discussion I was involved in with no good answer from WP:FILM. 

 :Sorry. If you do find anything, please let me know; I, of course, will do the same.  """,
2275,"""::Hmm...I think the difficulty is that in these arguments there are a lot of different issues.  For example, in the absolutism/relationalism stuff...the argument takes on a very specific tone in the primary texts that is pretty anachronistic (space as """"sensorium"""" in Clarke's letters for example)  So, I suppose it's useful to put these things into a more analytic framework whereby the issues really are these two: 

 1. Is Space-time an object (instead of substance)? and 
 2. Are there """"facts of the matter"""" concering spatio-temporal determinations (e.g. location)? 

 In general, then, an Idealist will certainly say no to (1), while it will depend what sort of anti-realism you subscribe to to know the answer to (1) (for example I think Putnam would say that spacetime is an object, per his system, but that VanFraassen would not). 

 But the answer to (2) is a bit complicated.  Leibniz, for example, although he didn't believe that spacetime was an object, does believe there are facts of the matter concerning the lengths of spatial intervals.  Conversely, Grunbaum, a realist about spacetime as an object, thought that all spatio-temporal determinations were conventional, i.e. set by some (arbitrary) co-ordinative definition.  To complicate matters again, Reichenbach held the self-same view about facts of the matter concerning spatiotemporal determinations, but was very much in the phenomenalist spirit of the positivists in general, and their neo-Kantian Plus view of the role of conceptualization in the setting of facts. 

 So I don't know, I get worried about the use of idealism and anti-realism in such close proximity to one another as they really are two different creatures.  Take for example the flow of time issue (I kind of short shrifted this section...should have said more probably).  Take the """"B-Theorist"""" solution to Mctaggart's paradox.  On this view, the paradox doesn't arise because a) A-determinations can be reduced to B-determinations (via some """"token-reflexive account"""" or what have you...where what """"It is raining now"""" comes out to / has as truth conditions """"The tokening of 'It is raining now' is simultaneous with it raining"""") and b) real change can be found in the B-series alone. 

 So, for a B-theorist the flow of time is merely a feature of our experience of time, not found in some objectively moving NOW.  Certainly we would call a b-theorist an anti-realist about the flow of time...but idealist?  I wouldn't think so...as they believe time (as the B-series) to be what it is independent of observers.  But again, to further muck up matters a B-theorist could still be a relationalist about spacetime (spacetime not an object but just a system of relations among events) and a conventionalist about spacetime determinations (e.g. lengths between objects). 
 Anyway, I'll stop typing now...Spacetimeguy 08:54, July 16, 2005

I am most familiar with tensors defined in terms of a vector space and its dual space, and this does can be done in the absence of a metric tensor.

2283,"Xerpheric Records Ltd. Founded in the UK, 2009 by Mark Flanagan. Xerpheric is not only a new label, but also a new word. This was to secure an original name that had not been registered by anyone before, for anything.  

 Originally, Mark Flanagan, ( from Feltham, in West London ) an artist, programmer, engineer & producer of abstract ambient tachno trance traded under the name; Headstate 68, and was set up in the attic studio, The Loft, Feltham, in 2007.  

 As an avid guitarist, Mark decided that he wanted guitaring in the tracks, but more akin to the electronic vibe. So he then set to work on his tunes, refining hooks and riffs, with trippy dubs to create the unique sound he was after. 

 However, in 2008, situations forced the move to a new studio, The Meads, in Chertsey, Surrey. The act then created a portal on Myspace to enable the world to listen to the tracks created, to guage how popular this type of music would be.  
 A reasonable success was apparent and therefore, these tracks were mastered and released on the album, Axatron on Apple's i.tunes for MP3 download, in February 2009. 

 Headstate 68's music was original and new, however, with material created by Mark Flanagan, dating back to 10 years it quickly became apparent that these older tracks, that represented the different genres of electronic dance music, that were never released, could be re-generated, re-programmed and re-mastered. However, not sounding like the classic slow tempo, guitar laden sound of Headstate 68's other acts were required to present these tracks to the populus. 

 Xerpheric Records Ltd was created in  March, 2009 to house these different types of electronic dance music and so the acts were created. 

 The following acts are currently signed to Xerpheric Records Ltd.  

 Headstate 68, Technoid Funk Master, The Retro System, Energy Generation & The Sound of Tronic Bionic UK. 

 At present, all the acts are working on material and will post 10 tracks on Myspace, then will be also released on i.tunes. 
 Once this has been acheived, the albums will be released on cd through the label website; xerpheric-record.com

 :Because it happened before the Genocide Convention and is an alleged genocide. See the section (and the main article) Genocide in history where many other alledged genocides and genocides are listed  

 The only reason it is considered 'alleged' is because modern-day Turkey (and its exclaves) deny it. The majority of the western academic world accepts and defines it as genocide. It certainly should be listed, particularly seeing as how it was used as an example in coining the word (see Raphael Lemkin).  

 :There was no international tribunal to try the perpetrators. Those who were tried were tried under domestic laws and as there was no such offence as genocide at that time so if they were found guilty they were found guilty of other crimes. There should not be any listing of the genocide  here because it is covered in the Genocide in history and it is only an alleged genocide given that there was no guilty verdict handed down by an international tribunal. The perpetrators of the Holocaust were not found guilty of Genocide but of crimes against humanity, but they were found guilty by an international tribunal of those crimes. I think it better that only incidents where people are found guilty of Genocide are listed in this article. Those incidents before the Convention, or incidents where there was not a trial, are listed in the article Genocide in history as it stops this article being the focus of POV wars.    

 ::Talat, Enver and Cemal all fled turkey before they could be tried under any court (though a Turkish military tribunal did try them in abstentia and find them guilty of war crimes) and all were killed ( Enver in Russia, Talat in Germany, and Cemal in Georgia) within 7 years. Just because the guilty parties fled justice (and because the Turkish tribunal is not international) does not mean these events did not occur. If the League of Nations, which had only been established only a year before Tallat’s death, had managed to apprehend these war criminals, then it surely would have found them guilty. The fact that a national court – the very nation they had controlled - found them guilty should be worth something.  

 ::: Although the information given in the article is the academic and judicial meaning of genocide, some critics are ultimately political. Cemal Pasha found guilty by the Ottoman Empire not because of he interfered any mass killing but beause he provoked the ethnic Arabs for a rebellion movement. The other misleading point is their murders. Cemal Pasha was murdered by Armenian paralimilitary groups in Tbilisi on 22nd July 1922, Talat Pasha was killed by an Armenian named Sogomon Tehliryan in Germany in 1921 and Enver Pasha was killed in Tajikistan on the 4th of August 1922 in battlefield.

 Props to Shiraz4 for the organizing of the Kongo kings into houses. However, there are errors in the assignment which I have sought to correct.  In the seventeenth century, it's clear that the acession of Alvaro I marks the advent of the house of Kwilu, and the other houses are also well documented.  For the later 18th and 19th century we need to do more research before we can assign house membership, as, although sources of the time refer to two or three houses, they don't always name them (this would be the Castello de Vide and Raimondo da Dicomano reports).  Hints about this are found in traditions, as recorded in Nkutama a mvila za makanda, and Kinkulu kia Nsi Eto, and their names might still be recoverable.  However, to do this would be to provide original research and until that is published it seems premature to put it in Wikipedia.

This time period is later retconned during the Crisis on Infinite Earths, and his period of absence is never again referenced."""" Not so. Shortly after his HoM feature ended, he made his first appearance in JLA in some time, leaving Earth with the Martians who have finally come for him. After this, he made very sporadic appearances for over a decade. He teamed up with Superman while World's Finest Comics was temporarily Batman-less, appeared in one 1974 issue of JLA, had a three-issue back-up miniseries in Adventure Comics that led directly into a team-up with Supes and Bats in World's Finest, did another isolated guest shot in JLA (playing cosmic-level chess with Despero), and permanently resurfaced in JLA when the book was severely reformatted (the satellite HQ was destroyed, Aquaman became chairman, new members included the similarly enhanced son of Steel the Indestructible Man, and a break-dancer). I don't think I missed anything. Over the course of these appearances, things on New Mars were developed. I am also unaware of any retconning away, via Crisis or any other way, of this period. Indeed, the early issues of the John Ostrander-written Martian Manhunter series (all I read because understanding the plot required more knowledge of what was going on in the League's own series than I had or wanted to get) seemed to deal with J'onzz's off-Earth period heavily, contradicting this assertion.

Therefore, if Edward VIII was indeed incapable of fathering children, and died in say the 1950s, he would have been succeeded by his younger brother Prince Albert, who would have become George VI anyway...only much later. When he died, say, in the 1960s-80s, presuming he had no sons (only Elizabeth and Margaret), Elizabeth would then have still become Elizabeth II. However, it is very questionable whether she would have married Prince Philip of Greece had her father not been King in 1947; therefore, she may have had either different children, or no children. In the latter scenario, all other things being equal, the present Duke of Gloucester would almost certainly be King Richard IV right now.",

 History & Growth 

 ATIC was established in 2008. Through a joint venture, ATIC and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) created the world's third largest independent foundry GlobalFoundries in early 2009.[3] 
 In late 2009, ATIC acquired Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing of Singapore, the world's second largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry.[4][5] 
 In January 2010, GlobalFoundries officially integrated operations with Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, and since that time have functioned as one company under the GlobalFoundries brand.[6]  
 (add) Since the integration of Chartered, GLOBALFOUNDRIES has grown to become the world’s second largest foundry company by revenue, and has a employee footprint of over 13,000 worldwide.  
 In August 2010, ATIC joined with other investors to fund Texas-based Calxeda, a start-up company which will eventually provide ARM-based computers for the server market.[7] 
 ATIC simultaneously “worked with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop a masters program in microelectronics at the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi.”[8][9] 
 Also in 2010, ATIC joined a university research partnership with the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) to conduct research in the Abu Dhabi region.[10] 
 In 2011, ATIC announced investments of $5.5 billion to expand manufacturing in Singapore, Dresden, Germany, and Saratoga County in New York state.[11][12] 
 ATIC also announced a $6–$8 billion computer chip factory in Abu Dhabi in development for completion in 2012.[13]  

 (add) While the initial Abu Dhabi was placed on hold due to larger economic circumstances, ATIC continues to pursue plans to build a fabrication facility within the Emirate. http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/technology/globalfoundries-in-profit-by-2015 

 (Add section) R&D 
 Towards; building a globally-competitive technology R&D; ecosystem within Abu Dhabi, ATIC has invested more than Dh100 million in research grants and funds since 2009.  
 http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/technology/abu-dhabi-eyes-growth-through-innovation 

 Research Grants 
 ATIC partners  with the Semiconductor Research Corporation, a leading university-research consortium, to drive local research towards minimum energy electronic systems. 
 This year, ATIC is supporting research initiatives spanning Khalifa University, UAE University, American University of Sharjah, Masdar Institute and New York University Abu Dhabi.

 In May, 2013, ATIC and the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) launched the ATIC-SRC Centre of Excellence for Energy Efficient Electronic Systems (ACE4S), to be hosted jointly in Abu Dhabi by Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, and Masdar Institute of Science and Technology.

Why did Sato write Eureka Seven willingly, despite the foreseen criticism? Such contexts are almost never mentioned abroad. 

 ...DS: One thing I can say is that my work tends to enjoy a better reputation abroad than in Japan. This might be because the images of my work have, ironically, helped define “Japanimation” for non-Japanese audiences. If this is the case, it didn’t happen consciously on my part. The particular works which have influenced us in turn, happened to come from cultures of Europe and the U.S. I don’t think anybody here has seen Eureka Seven, but I applied dance music and subcultural references to the script, two things that are essential for me. This may sound trivial, but it is quite interesting that a kind of a debate between subculture and otaku exists in Japan. I feel like I’ve been positioned at the very center of this…so I feel awkward having my works walk on their own. I don’t know if this answered the question…

I wanted to write a story of youths who live in a world that has already ended; with recognition that the term “New Wave” is no longer “new.” This is why I’ve chosen dance music, techno and house as a theme, instead of hip-hop this time.

If there are 100,000 fighters, fragmented into 1,000 bands, and half of them being jihadists, fundamentalists, islamist etc. then every single fighter in the other """"moderate"""" group would have to be a member of the FSA, just so we would get to the cca 50,000 number.

 The extremes of both the left and the right have hijacked Enoch Powell. The left use him (incorrectly, in my view) as a leader of the racist parts of our political system.

So the left want nothing except Powell's supposed racism to appear in any Wikipedia article about him, whilst the right also want Powell's views to be misrepresented, so that they appear to have a well-known politician espousing their views.

 == Anarchism and how long could it exist == 

 Well I was thinking about anarchism this day and I've bumped into a problem: 

 1.) Anarchism from a Capitalist State 

 If there's a goodly working Capitalist Democracy, and then through a revolution it turns into Anarchism(wich is the abolishment of every law and governmental oppression) Companies would surely take the power because only they have enough money for weapons. So Anarchism will become """"Capitalism Liber"""" wich isn't really better than the original government, because they could even kill the residents if they want to. 

 2.) Anarchism from a Communist State 

 Yes, I've already philosophised about how anarchism created from a socialist society would work(nearly everything is controlled by state and there's strict authority) then it would turn out like this: New groups would form and there would be a bloody competition for previously state-controlled facilities and they will taxatate the use of them so it's basically the same """"Capitalism Liber"""". 

 3.) So how anarchism could be stable? 

 Well, I think that the strongest bond that could hold the people together in the state of absolute freedom is Religion. Maybe if there would be a religion wich STRICTLY OPPOSES CAPITALISM, and MONEY Anarchism could be maintained by the followers of that religion. And if there would be an ORGANIZED MILITARY just for DEFENCE, than this would hold people together also and defend from invasions, and it won't destroy the ABSOLUTLY FREE STATE OF SOCIETY.

Hoffman (Popular Aviation, March 1935, pp 163 and 196), and also one of the Fauvel flying wings, the AV-10; in YouTube, connected to the Arup airplanes films, some other low aspect ratio inverted-delta like wings appear. There was another example of circular wing, similar to the Coleoptere but of an ordinary width proposed in a hobbyists' magazine to be built as toy, but I'm not currently able to retrieve the image and plans.

So, the follow-up section should read “This isn't the only form of marriage that exits in Islam. Both the Muta in Shia and Misyar in Sunnism sharing many similar properties with slight differences is an alternate to the Nikah. And both has been heavily criticized by proponent on the issue of validity and practices by those who believe that Nikah is the only legitimate form of marriage.” With this sentence you can start with an indepth look at why people are rejecting all the alternates to Nikah. The follow-up to this would be to answer the criticism and explain the point of views from the supporters of Misyar and Muta. I will be back to answer questions and elaborate on this idea.

2642,"""1.This test uses a boring machine to present soil strength as N-value by driving a sampler into the ground for 30cm by blows from a slide hammer, and N-value resolution is per 1m so data only represents 30% of entire depth.  
 's Comment: is not actually a problem with the test, but with the method used in Japan to report the test results. In the U.S., one N-value isn't taken to represent a full one-meter interval, but only the 30 cm (or shorter) interval over which the sampler was driven. 
 's comment: I understand. This only applies to Japan, and the US civil industry analyze the ground consecutively, but the source also points out the interval is not always 30cm. This seems to be true in the US as well. And instead of deleting, one could point out this as the problem of the Japanese civil industry.  

 2. Measured data are neither linear scaling nor normal distribution, but logarithmic normal distribution. 
 's Comment: doesn't actually mean anything - there's a difference between a """"scaling"""" and a """"distribution"""".  
 : Soil strength is very wide ranged from the N-value zero to super hard rock, and if the researchers would like to be able to analyze the wide range of data, the scale needs to be exponential. 

 3. The method employees such a primitive method counting a number of blows of a slide hammer, it cannot collect accurate data for weak soil layers. 
 's Comment: The primitiveness of the method is not *why* it is inaccurate for weak soils. 
 's comment: The source does not use the term “primitive.” The source says “Problematic N-value zero.” But the hammer uses the accelerated force, and strong force tends to drive away everything.  
 One can tell that there is a great difference in how the force is applied to a matter using a sledgehammer pounding or using a drill and slowly squeezing out. The results are limited to whole numbers for a specific driving interval. This is very true, and the use of sledgehammer is the source of the problem. 
 In this 21st century or the high-tech century, is the use of sledgehammer and counting the blows the most sophisticated method to analyze the delicate and sensitive matter such as the ground?  This is why I used *primitive.* 

 From here is based on other document, but it does support my point. 
 Even if SPT N-value is consecutively measured, the sledgehammer drives in the sampler with acceleration. At the presence of gravels easily crackable by the boring machine, the N-value will be the average of the gravels and that location.  If the gravel is relatively strong, the blow will be consumed with the gravel's entire surface area so at the weak layer the entire surface area of the gravels will be measured, and the resulting N-value will be bigger even at the presence of the weak layer. 

 A sliding layer that would cause a landslide is a couple of centimeter thickness and slide with water so one cannot detect the sliding layers with the standard penetration method. 

 Recently there have been many landslides due to this reason; with the boring machine it is very hard to detect this sliding layers. Especially, the method cannot detect 0 to 3 N-value weak layers. 

 Some words could have been strong, but I do not believe they were wrong at all. 
 I believe the discussion is essential to improve everything. I welcome feedback. Thank you.

To say someone is a terrorist requires a judgment to be made, and judgments can always be questioned, just as Laveol questioned yours. As I have tried to explain, it is appropriate for Wikipedia to record the opinions of responsible commentators, but it should have no opinions of its own.

 Having said all that, there is a very basic difference between Greeks in Turkey and Turks in Greece. After the pogroms of 1955 and the general ethnic cleansing policies of the Kemalist state, there are perhaps 1000 Greeks or less left in Turkey, most of them in Istanbul. The Greeks did NOT ethnic cleanse the Turks. Turks are perhaps a hundred times more and they occupy a large portion of two prefectures (Rhodopi and Xanthi). Greece, contrary to acquis communautaire and because of strict adherence to the Lausanne treaty, still lets the mufti perform lots of administrative and judicial duties.

 The sea-borne trade of the Ottoman Empire was predominantly in Greek hands: there were many Armenian, Turkish, Arab and Jewish merchants, but they kept to the land. In the late eighteenth century trade substantially increased, and Greek seafarers did well out of it. In the Aegean islands, especially Hydra and Chios, bigger and more modern ships were built, and shipbuilding and trading families made substantial fortunes. It is important to note that the Greek population was widely and thinly distributed within the Ottoman Empire, and that there were also Greek communities in foreign cities. In the peninsula and the Aegean islands the population was compactly Greek, though considerable numbers of Turks dwelt among them in some of the towns. Greeks formed large urban minorities in Constantinople, Alexandria, Bucharest, Iasi the ports of the lower Danube, and in the coastal cities of Asia Minor both in the Aegean and the Black Sea. There were also many Greek villages in the interior of Asia Minor. Outside the Ottoman Empire, the lonian islands had a mainly Greek population. They belonged to the republic of Venice until 1797. were then occupied in turn by French, Russians and British, and came into British possession by the Vienna peace settlement, Further a field, there were Greek merchant communities in Trieste, Venice, Vienna, Amsterdam and other West European cities. During the eighteenth century European education and ideas made themselves felt among a considerable part of the Greek people The Phanariot princes of Moldavia and Wallachia supported some excellent schools and collected libraries of European books. Knowledge of French was quite widespread at their courts. Constantinople also had good schools, and foreign languages were spoken and foreign literature read. Wealthy islanders founded schools from their trade and profits. Under Venetian rule the Ionian Islands offered Greeks the chance of education and access to Italian culture. Small but growing numbers of Greeks from the Ottoman Empire studied abroad, especially at Padua but also at Vienna, Leipzig and other German universities. Greek colonies in Western Europe helped the education of their compatriots both by inviting individuals to study in the West and by sending money to found and support schools on ottoman territory. 

 Increasing contact with the West introduced the ideas of the European Enlightenment to Greeks. This process was encouraged by many of the Phanariot rulers of Moldavia and Wallachia, but was disapproved by the patriarchate, although individual priests and even bishops favoured it. Natural science and rationalism were felt as a threat to Orthodox piety. Especially important was the cult of ancient Greece in European Enlightenment literature. Classical learning and thought were praised by the philosophers of the West as older than, and superior to. Christianity. Greeks in the West learned through this literature about their own past, which, if not entirely ignored, had at least been very little known to the intellectual elite of Constantinople either in the last period of the Byzantine empire or under Ottoman rule. The presentation to the educated Greek public of ancient Hellas, as seen through the eyes of French encyclopaedists and sentimental Western philhellenes, was above all the work of Adamantios Korais (174.8-1833). A native of Smyrna, who had spent six years in Amsterdam and six in Montpellier, and from 1788 until the end of his long life lived in Paris, Korais was an indefatigable author of translations, original works, articles and letters. He devoted himself to the propagation of the Enlightenment among the Greeks and of the Greek cause among the French, and above all to the development of a literary Modern Greek Language, to be formed by the infusion of classical words into the spoken tongue and by the systematisation of its formal structure. Korais took care not to attack religion or the Orthodox Church as such, but he fought bitterly against all customs, institutions and ideas which seemed to him to  
 be superstitious survivals from an age of darkness, preventing a return to a glorious past which would also embody in itself all the wisdom of new enlightened Europe. 
 The Orthodox hierarchy disliked this mixture of classics and rationalism, They too were becoming impatient of Ottoman rule as they saw it declining, they too were becoming affected by a new pride in being Greeks.

 Please excise from the Preamble heading the paragraphs I've reproduced below, in which the text of the Preamble is dissected, needlessly, and made subject to a myriad of specious editorial claims that are not and will never be substantiable, no matter how many sources one tacks on after the period. The text of the Constitution is the text of the Constitution. To assume that """"a more perfect union"""" refers back to the government under the Articles of Confederation is to take a liberty that the context doesn't allow. The phrase may be referencing England or France or the Ottoman Empire. It may be an expression of the founder's desire to create a union more perfect than all the unions that have come before and all the unions that have yet to come. Unfortunately, the Constitution doesn't explain what exactly it means by """"a more perfect union"""" and as a result neither can we. In addition to being groundless, the analysis is riddled with nonsense terms, such as """"the powers of the earth,"""" """"social contract of democratic philosophy,"""" and """"things of a general welfare."""" The final sentence of the second paragraph is plainly incoherent.  

 Ultimately, my request is that the paragraphs at issue be deleted and replaced with the text of the Preamble verbatim. 

 -""""One people"""" dissolved their connection with another, and assumed among the powers of the earth, a sovereign nation-state. The scope of the Constitution is twofold. First, """"to form a more perfect Union"""" than had previously existed in the """"perpetual Union"""" of the Articles of Confederation. Second, to """"secure the blessings of liberty"""", which were to be enjoyed by not only the first generation, but for all who came after, """"our posterity"""".[27] 

 It is an itemized social contract of democratic philosophy. It details how the more perfect union was to be carried out between the national government and the people. The people are to be provided justice, civil peace, common defense, those things of a general welfare that they could not provide themselves, and freedom. A government of """"liberty and union, now and forever"""", unfolds when """"We"""" begin and establish this Constitution.

Other words with special Wikipedia jargon properties (like consensus) are spelt out in detail.  It seems to me that the same should be done for synthesis.  And I've little doubt that many others feel the same way.  I'm sure we could find a few other editors interested in making things clearer.",

 Hi, AzureCitizen!  Regarding this edit of yours, while you correctly identified the contested """"McRaven"""" text in the most recent edit war on that article, did you overlook the fact that those same warriors were also contesting any mention of that group's associations with the Republican Party and Tea Party?  They were purging both sets of content with the same revert.  IMO, their associations are relevant information in any article that mentions that group, their videos, their attack ads, or their targets.   

 It's the Swifties all over again:  create political attack ads and videos; spam them as much as possible, while innocently denying any political motivation, before fact checkers, investigative journalists, etc., eventually dissect, expose and discredit the group and their attacks.  Then they will slither back under their rock after election season, smug about the shitstorm they kicked up, and uncaring about the tarnished reputation they leave stuck to their unfortunate apolitical bretheren that share a military unit or service branch with these asshats.

I think that the conclusion that  stated was largely inevitable and I agree with it; but, I for one would have welcomed a closer focus on what I saw as the central flaw in CartoonDiablo's table, since I believe that that flaw goes to much more profound questions of epistemology than were addressed in the debates, namely: 1) the proper status and interpretation of meta-analyses, and 2) the interpretation of 'absence of evidence'.  
 ::While not having any great formal expertise on these issues (which is why I did suggest obtaining an opinion from someone with expertise in scientific research in general, rather than from someone within the clinical sphere, who would, apparently, likely have some bias one way or another in the CBT vs psychodynamic wars), can I say - for what it's worth - that I think that CartoonDiablo fell into error on a couple of fundamental points: Firstly, he greatly over-rated the significance of meta-analyses generally, apparently believing that quantity of studies included in the meta-analysis was in itself a measure of merit, whereas in fact the particular methodology used is very significant, and systematic error and bias are not always easily discernible in such studies: the article on Meta-analysis describes some of these disadvantages and weaknesses. 
 ::Secondly, he interpreted the 'holes/absences/silences' in the French study as grounds for making a positive assertion, ie, """"No effect"""". This is an error and a fundamental problem in epistemology: Argument from ignorance#Distinguishing absence of evidence from evidence of absence|Distinguishing absence of evidence from evidence of absence''. 
 ::Given that the logical conclusion flowing from the sum total of disputes about this issue would appear to be that there are strong grounds for removal of the table from all of the articles, I would have liked to have seen a bit more thorough analysis and discussion on the specific points I raised. I'm not necessarily asking for the dispute to be reopened, but I think it could have been concluded a bit more satisfactorily.   """,

 hello athenean some time ago i had made edits to the article arvanites that were reverted by user olahus for no reason..but some other ip which is apparently of a banned user ALSO edited it and it was protected so now i cant edit it..i mainly added some information on demography and streamlined some sections see here and the edits following it. since its good content and not contentious or disputable do you think you could add it back? i think olahus might have protested the removal of some old ethnographic maps he added to wikipedia but they are irrelevant in that article where the arvanitic areas are specifically mentioned in words..(what do maps of epirus have to do with it anyway?)",

 ::::Not only on that, but also to the fact that Allied Control Commission presented a list of acceptable convictions to Paasikivi after the pre-decision of the court was presented which would have released Kivimäki and given only a small sentence to Tanner.

 ″Eventually, the British Army occupied Athens and Piraeus in the aftermath of the German withdrawal, and fought a street-by-street battle to drive ELAS from these cities and impose an interim government under Archbishop Damaskinos. SOE's last act was to evacuate several hundred disarmed EDES fighters to Corfu, preventing their massacre by ELAS.[87]″ 

 Whatever the truth of what happened in autumn 1944, the Foot reference, which I have as page 340, a long way from page 236, so a mere change in edition is unlikely to have brought this about, only provides minimal support to the text. Foot has no reference to an imminent massacre. If as implied SOE had successfully fought for control of Athens, why was an evacuation necessary?

 Six months ago I anchored myself into Wikipedia history as the sole creator of the Ernest Scared Stupid article. It was my little niche in the World Wide Web, a place I could retreat to and acknowledge as my contribution to Planet Earth. 

 My happy little world was shattered a couple days ago when I made a daily visit to Wikipedia only to discover your modifications. The Ernest Scared Stupid article had been edited by other users in the past, and often to my disliking, but never to the degree that would warrant me trying to reform the changes made and eventually writing a letter voicing my disappointment. 

 You seem to have re-formatted every Ernest movie article in a very generic, formulaic format. All of “your articles” are bound by a bland sense of rule-following: Title, year, genre, star, director, plot, MPAA rating (and followed by) Cast, Plot, and Trivia. To your extensive editing I have the following to say: This is Wikipedia, not IMDB. 

 I don’t mind you adding facts such as MPAA rating, cast, etc. But do you have to do so in an ugly, database format? Believe it or not, each article of an encyclopedia (and especially a wiki encyclopedia) is unique and has artistic merit largely due to the fact that the articles are written by a diverse range of people and do not conform to one another. For example, the article on Guyana is formatted similar to, but not the same as, the article on Suriname. The photographs are not in the exact same spots and the Content Boxes are not identical. Would the Ernest films be so great if they were all bound by the same exact plot structure? 

 So congratulations, you have edited every single Ernest movie article. Any casual research on any Ernest film will feature ideas and information provided by a high school student from Connecticut (this fact is used merely to point out the narrowness of the source, not to discredit your age or location.) I seriously feel you are turning Wikipedia into a dull, Communist-style building complex. Ten gray buildings resting side by side, 24 rooms each, 48 windows, etc. Spice things up.",
